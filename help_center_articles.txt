Welcome to the connected workspace where better, faster work happens. Let’s cover all the things you need to know to begin exploring Notion.
Start here

Chunk 20:
Curious about what Notion is? We'll show you right here, and in the articles to come. Let's go! 📍
What is a block?
 Think of Notion as a bottomless bin of building blocks. Build whatever you want, however you want! Every page you create in Notion will be composed of many "blocks," in the same way a LEGO castle is composed of many LEGO bricks 🧱
Create a page
 Every page you create in Notion is a fresh canvas where you can add whatever content you want. Follow these steps to create your first one 📄
Create a subpage
 There are no folders in Notion. Instead, you can organize pages inside pages... inside pages. Here, we'll show you how to create a page within another page, which we call a subpage 📑
What is a database?

Chunk 21:
Databases are a core feature in Notion that help you manage and organize your pages. Let's explain what they are and how they can help you level up your workspace 🗄
Create a database
 Now we'll create a database and use it to show off essential database actions and features. You'll get to play with database properties, views, filters, and sorts - let's get into it 📈
Start with a template
 To help you take on a variety of challenges with Notion, we've created lots of templates that you can adopt and customize as your own — including 5 "starter templates" already in your workspace! Here's how to use them 💾
Share your work

Chunk 22:
Share any Notion page you create with select people, your whole team, or the entire web. It's up to you. Here's a quick overview of how to share 🗣
Collaborate with people
 Notion has several features designed to improve and increase the velocity of communication with your team — whether you're all editing the same page or working across time zones 🤝

 We like to describe Notion as a set of building blocks for creating things you love to use on your computer, such as:
• Documents

Chunk 32:
• Public websites

Think of Notion as a bottomless bin of building blocks. Build whatever you want, however you want! Every page you create in Notion will be composed of many "blocks," in the same way a LEGO castle is composed of many LEGO bricks 🧱

Chunk 36:
• Everything in Notion is a "block"
• Blocks can be rearranged
Everything in Notion is a "block"
 When you create your first page in Notion and begin typing, you've started with a text block. But Notion pages can contain a lot more than plain text!
 Imagine every piece of content you add to a page — whether it's text, an image, or a table — as a single building block. Every page is a stack of blocks combined however you want.
 Here's just one example page with different block types pointed out:
 Tip: Hit the / key on your keyboard (or tap the + button above your keyboard if you're on mobile) to see all the different types of content you can add.
Blocks can transform

Chunk 37:
Any block in Notion can be turned into any other type of block in order to use, view, or deepen that information in a new way.
 Try this out by clicking the ⋮⋮ symbol and choosing Turn into to convert your block to something else!
Blocks can be rearranged
 The ⋮⋮ button can be used to drag and drop existing blocks. This makes it simple to rearrange, reorder, and reshape your thoughts with one motion.

• Start writing
• Try a slash command
Create a page

Chunk 41:
There are a few ways to add a new page in Notion.
• Click 📝 at the top of your left sidebar.
• If you’re on the desktop app, use the shortcut cmd/ctrl + N.
• If you’re on mobile, tap 📝 at the bottom of your screen.
 Click 📝 at the top of your left sidebar.
 If you’re on the desktop app, use the shortcut cmd/ctrl + N.
 If you’re on mobile, tap 📝 at the bottom of your screen.
Start writing
 Once your new page opens, you can give your page a title and start jotting down your thoughts.

Chunk 42:
Need some inspiration or structure? On desktop or web, select any of the options at the bottom of the page to get started. You can import from an app or file, use a template, create a table, and more — select an option you like, and your page will be formatted accordingly!
 As you write, highlight any text on your page to bring up a menu of options. You can change the color or style of your text, add a comment or hyperlink, and more. Learn more about writing and editing basics here →
Try a slash command
 The / command will quickly become your best friend in Notion.

Chunk 43:
• Typing / brings up a comprehensive menu of block types - all of your content options. Experiment with different block types - you'll find your own personal favorite combinations!
• Add any type of block by typing / and scrolling to the one you want or typing its name. For instance, /h1 creates a large heading, and /todo creates a checkbox.

Your Notion workspace is the home for all your content. You can work in your workspace alone or share your workspace with collaborators — it's up to you! Here, we'll teach you how to create, join, and use workspaces.

Chunk 53:
Intro to workspaces
 Everything you do in Notion takes place in a workspace. It's your virtual home to organize information and create exactly the way you want — as just one person, together as a team, or across a whole company. Expand, edit, and mold it to fit your needs 🏠
Navigate with the sidebar
 Notion's left-hand sidebar makes it easy to structure all the content in your workspace. Here's everything you need to know on how to organize, rearrange, and find your pages within the sidebar 🧭

When you're brand new to Notion, it's best to keep it simple and start with just one workspace. But as you start using Notion for more things, and with more groups of people, you can keep different kinds of content separate by using multiple workspaces 🏘
Create & navigate teamspaces
 Teamspaces help keep your content organized into specific areas. Keep your sidebar tidy by joining just the ones you need to access! Here's how 📚

Your Notion workspace is the home for all your content. You can work in your workspace alone or share your workspace with collaborators — it's up to you! Here, we'll teach you how to create, join, and use workspaces.

Chunk 59:
Intro to workspaces
 Everything you do in Notion takes place in a workspace. It's your virtual home to organize information and create exactly the way you want — as just one person, together as a team, or across a whole company. Expand, edit, and mold it to fit your needs 🏠
Navigate with the sidebar
 Notion's left-hand sidebar makes it easy to structure all the content in your workspace. Here's everything you need to know on how to organize, rearrange, and find your pages within the sidebar 🧭

Workspace basics
 Your Notion app interface is split into two sections: the sidebar and the editor.
Sidebar
• Notion's expandable sidebar is your navigation system.

Chunk 66:
• All the pages and databases you create will appear here.
• The sidebar contains several sections, which you can reorder and customize.
• You can nest pages inside each other for infinite levels of organization.
• It's also home to your settings, trash, and other tools.

Editor
• This is where all the content you create lives.

Chunk 67:
• Control menus are at the top (we'll go through those in more detail), but otherwise, Notion's editor is a blank canvas for you to write, plan, brainstorm, and more.
• You'll notice that as soon as you start typing in this space, those top menus fade into the background, leaving you with your thoughts in a spacious zone of focus.

Team vs. personal workspaces
 A workspace operates slightly differently if you're using it with a team than if you're using it on your own:
• In personal workspaces, newly created pages will be private by default unless they're explicitly shared.

Chunk 85:
• Sidebar organization under the Teamspace section is also viewable by all members. The page arrangement will look the same to everyone, although individuals can toggle different pages open or closed without affecting everyone's view.
• On Notion's Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan, there are members and admins with different levels of permission. Learn more about sharing and permissions here →

FAQs
 Can I switch between workspaces that are associated with different email addresses?
 To add your workspaces from another email account, use the Add another account button in the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and follow the steps to login to your other account. More on this here →
 I clicked the Create or Join Workspace button, but it will only let me create a workspace. How do I join a workspace?

Chunk 87:
You can only join a workspace via the Create or Join Workspace button if that workspace has the Allowed Email Domains setting enabled, which lets users with your email domain join the workspace automatically.
 To join a workspace, you'll need to ask an admin from that workspace to send you an invite.
 To add your workspaces from another email account, use the Add another account button in the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and follow the steps to login to your other account. More on this here →
 My sidebar doesn't have any sections. How do I turn those on?

Chunk 88:
The sidebar sections reflect the sharing settings of your account. If you have more than one person in your workspace, a Teamspaces section appears in the sidebar for your collaborative work with that person, and the Private section is there for your personal pages that are only visible to you.
 When I subscribe to a Plus Plan, does it cover all my workspaces?
 Paid plans only apply to one workspace, and don't cover the whole account. Workspaces are completely separate, so you won't be able to link any content between them.
 We recommend using the least number of workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.
 How can I migrate all my Notion content to a different workspace?

Chunk 89:
Note: Any migrated content will be duplicated to the new workspace and these pages sometimes have issues. For more information, click here.
 To move your content from one workspace to another associated with the same account, click
•
•
• next to each of the top-level pages in your sidebar (or right click) and select Move to. At the bottom of the move menu, you’ll see a drop down to select a different workspace.
 When you move top-level pages, all their sub-pages go with them. They'll appear in the Private section but can be moved wherever you want to put them.
 What if I accidentally deleted something permanently? Any way to get it back?

Chunk 90:
If you accidentally delete a page, a workspace, or even your entire account, we can help! Accidents happen 😅 Just send us a message in the app by clicking ? at the bottom left on desktop (or in your sidebar on mobile). Or email us at team@makenotion.com.
 We keep backups of our database, which allows us to restore a snapshot of your content in the past 30 days if you need it.
 How do I log out of my Notion account?
 Click on your current workspace's name at the very top left of your sidebar. Scroll to the bottom, and you'll see the option to Log out next to your email address.

 To add a page to your favorites, navigate to it, then click ⭐ at the top of it. You'll see it appear under Favorites in your sidebar.
 To remove a page from your favorites, open it and unclick ⭐ at the top. You can also hover over the page in your sidebar and click

 For database pages, you can open the toggle to see all the different views you've created of that database. These are represented with a
• next to them.
Settings, templates, and trash

FAQs
 How do I log out of my Notion account?

Chunk 116:
Click on your current workspace's name at the very top left of your sidebar. Scroll to the bottom, and you'll see the option to Log out next to your email address.
 My sidebar doesn't have any sections. How do I turn those on?
 The sidebar sections reflect the sharing settings of your account. If you have more than one person in your workspace, a Teamspaces section appears in the sidebar for your collaborative work with that person, and the Private section is there for your personal pages that are only visible to you.
 Can I rename the sidebar sections or add my own custom sections?
 Not at the moment, unfortunately 😓 If your sidebar is feeling cluttered, you can always consolidate some of your pages under more top-level pages.

Create & manage workspaces
 When you're brand new to Notion, it's best to keep it simple and start with just one workspace. But as you start using Notion for more things, and with more groups of people, you can keep different kinds of content separate by using multiple workspaces 🏘

Chunk 120:
When you're brand new to Notion, it's best to keep it simple and start with just one workspace. But as you start using Notion for more things, and with more groups of people, you can keep different kinds of content separate by using multiple workspaces 🏘
• Join an existing workspace
• Switch between workspaces
• Delete a workspace
• Add another email account
• Log out of an account
Create a new workspace
 By default, your workspace switcher will display all the workspaces associated with your email address. To create another workspace:
 Open the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window.

Chunk 121:
Choose which email account you'd like the new workspace to be associated with, and click the
•
•
• to the right of that email address.
 Click Join or create workspace.
 If you're using your work email, you may see a list of workspaces that you can auto-join. We'll cover that just below!
 If you want to create a brand new workspace, scroll past the list of existing workspaces and click Create workspace.
 Follow the steps to set up your new workspace and you're on your way!
 Tip: Multiple workspaces come in handy to separate different kinds of work. For example, you could have one workspace for personal stuff, one for school notes, and one for keeping track of freelance projects.
Join an existing workspace

Chunk 122:
There are a couple ways to join a workspace someone else has made:
• An admin from that workspace adds you as a member, and you receive an email with a link to join. You'll be prompted to sign in with your email, and you'll be placed into the workspace as a paid member.
• If your email domain (e.g. name@domain.com) has auto-join enabled, you can use the Join or create workspace button in the workspace switcher, and you'll see a list of workspaces you can join.
 An admin from that workspace adds you as a member, and you receive an email with a link to join. You'll be prompted to sign in with your email, and you'll be placed into the workspace as a paid member.

Chunk 123:
If your email domain (e.g. name@domain.com) has auto-join enabled, you can use the Join or create workspace button in the workspace switcher, and you'll see a list of workspaces you can join.
 Note: If you're using Notion with a personal email address such as gmail.com or outlook.com, or a school email address such as nyu.edu, you won't be able to auto-join other workspaces.
 To join a workspace from another email account, use the Add another account button in the workspace switcher.
Switch between workspaces
 Throughout the day, you might need to hop between different workspaces to get things done. Just click on the name of your current workspace and select the one you want to jump to from the dropdown menu. That's it!

Chunk 124:
You can also access Settings from the workspace switcher.
 Tip: On desktop, you can use the shortcut ctrl + shift + # to switch workspaces, in which # corresponds to the placement of each workspace in the dropdown workspace switcher menu.
 You'll see the shortcuts in the menu, next to each workspace name!
Leave a workspace
 Once you leave a workspace:
• You’ll lose access to all of the content inside it. You might want to export any data that you want to keep after you leave the workspace.
• It’ll be removed from your workspace switcher.
• You can ask an admin to re-add you to the workspace if you want to access it again.

Chunk 125:
You’ll lose access to all of the content inside it. You might want to export any data that you want to keep after you leave the workspace.
 It’ll be removed from your workspace switcher.
 You can ask an admin to re-add you to the workspace if you want to access it again.
 To leave a workspace:
 Go to Settings in your sidebar.
 Select Settings.
 Scroll down to Danger zone and select Leave workspace.
Delete a workspace
 Once a workspace is deleted:
• This action is permanent.
• All of the content inside of it will be deleted. You won’t be able to access your content — even your private pages. You might want to export any data that you want to keep after you delete the workspace.

Chunk 126:
• The deleted workspace will be deleted for everyone in it. This means all users who were part of a workspace before it was deleted will no longer have access to that workspace or any content inside that workspace.
• You'll be returned to another workspace you belong to, or the sign up page for Notion if you don't belong to any others.
 This action is permanent.
 All of the content inside of it will be deleted. You won’t be able to access your content — even your private pages. You might want to export any data that you want to keep after you delete the workspace.

Chunk 127:
The deleted workspace will be deleted for everyone in it. This means all users who were part of a workspace before it was deleted will no longer have access to that workspace or any content inside that workspace.
 You'll be returned to another workspace you belong to, or the sign up page for Notion if you don't belong to any others.
 To delete a workspace:
 Go to Settings in your sidebar.
 Select Settings.
 Scroll down to Danger zone and select Delete entire workspace. You'll be asked to type the name of your workspace to confirm you want to proceed.
Add another email account

Chunk 128:
By default, your workspace switcher will display all the workspaces associated with your email address. But you may prefer to use your personal email with your personal workspaces, and your work email with your team workspaces.
 To enable you to view all of your workspaces at once, we support logging in with multiple accounts at the same time!
 To add workspaces from another Notion account, open the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and click Add another account.
 Follow the steps to login to your other account, and you'll be taken straight to that workspace. You can also create a new account at this step.

Chunk 129:
The next time you open the workspace switcher, you'll see the new account and all of its workspaces added to the dropdown.
 Tip: By adding more accounts to your workspace switcher, there's no need to log out of one account in order to log into another! This lets you keep work and life separate, while making sure that you can access any of your content across any account, on any device, completely seamlessly.
Log out of an account
 You can log out of individual accounts, or log out of all your accounts at once.
 Open the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window.
 To log out of one account but stay logged into others, use the
•
•
• button to the right of the account you want to log out of. Then, click Log out.

Chunk 130:
To log out of all your accounts at once, use the Log out all button at the bottom of the workspace switcher.
 Note: Login tokens expire after 90 days. When you're logged out of your accounts due to token expiration, you will need to re-add any additional accounts by using the Add another account button in the workspace switcher.
FAQs
 How can I migrate all my Notion content to a different workspace?
 Note: Any migrated content will be duplicated to the new workspace and these pages sometimes have issues. For more information, click here.

Chunk 131:
To move your content from one workspace to another associated with the same account, click
•
•
• next to each of the top-level pages in your sidebar (or right click) and select Move to. At the bottom of the move menu, you’ll see a drop down to select a different workspace.
 When you move top-level pages, all their sub-pages go with them. They'll appear in the Private section but can be moved wherever you want to put them.
 I clicked the Join or create workspace button, but it will only let me create a workspace. How do I join a workspace?
 You can only join a workspace via the Join or create workspace button if that workspace has the Allowed Email Domains setting enabled to allow users with your email domain join the workspace automatically.

Chunk 132:
Otherwise, you'll need to ask an admin from the workspace to send you an invite.
 When I subscribe to a paid plan, does it cover all of my workspaces?
 Paid plans only apply to one workspace and don't cover the whole account. Workspaces are completely separate silos, so you won't be able to link any content between them.
 We recommend using the least number of workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.
 How can I switch between workspaces that are under different email addresses?
 To add your workspaces from another email account, use the Add another account button in the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and follow the steps to login to your other account.

Chunk 133:
Is there a limit to the number of accounts I can be signed into?
 There is currently no limit, although you may experience slower performance if you're logged into 10+ accounts at once.
 I forgot to log out of my account on a public computer, or my device was stolen.
 So sorry for the trouble 😓 If you're still logged in on a device you have access to, navigate to Settings → My account → Log out of all devices.
 If you no longer have access to your account, please send us a quick message to team@makenotion.com, or use the Notion AI face at the bottom right of the app. We can log you out remotely!

At its simplest, Notion can be used as a straightforward text editor — but you can spruce up your Notion pages with all kinds of blocks that are flexible and customizable.

 Partial text selection across blocks will be supported on all platforms except Firefox. We’re actively working with the Mozilla team to enable this feature in Firefox as soon as possible.
Drag-and-drop
 Any content block in Notion (including lines of text) can be dragged and dropped around the page. This includes rows in tables and cards in boards and galleries!
• Hover over any block and use the ⋮⋮ icon that appears as a handle to drag it around.
• Blue guides will appear to show you where it will go. (A good way to nest bullets and to-do's.)
• Release your mouse to drop the block, table row, or card wherever you want it to go.

Chunk 178:
• Drag-and-drop also works in your sidebar to reorder pages, nest pages inside pages, and move them between sections.

FAQs
 Can I make Full width my default? Is there a way to set a default style for all pages?

Chunk 185:
Not yet, but a lot of users have asked for this! We're continuing to keep this in mind for future projects.
 Can I justify text to be center aligned or right aligned?
 Notion doesn't have any traditional alignment options at the moment, unfortunately 😕But you can still make this happen. Drag and drop an empty line into the column next to your text to align it to the right or left.
 Is there a way to disable the menu that appears every time I type /?
 There's no way to turn this off by default for now, but you can press esc as soon as it pops up in order to dismiss it.
 How can I copy text from multiple blocks?

Chunk 186:
On desktop, click and drag from the left or right page margin to select an entire block of content, or multiple blocks at a time. Click & drag from within a block to select, cut, copy & paste partial text across paragraphs, bullet lists, callouts & more — without having to select each block in its entirety.
 On mobile, double tap to select text, and drag your selection to include content across multiple blocks.

Columns
 Sometimes, it makes sense to put pieces of information next to each other. In these situations, you can format your text into columns (or create side-by-side sections with headings) using drag and drop:
• Click and drag the text you want to put in another column. (The ⋮⋮ symbol in the left margin is your handle for drag and drop.)
• Follow the blue guides that appear.
• Drop it where you want it. You just created a new column!
• You can create as many columns as you want across the width of a page.

Chunk 191:

Chunk 192:
• Click the ⋮⋮ icon and hold to drag the content in your right-hand column back under or above the content in the left-hand column. When you see the blue guide span the width of the page, drop it and the columns should disappear.
• Sometimes, it's possible to have an empty column. In this case, click the ⋮⋮ icon and select Delete. This also removes the column format.

Table of contents
 If you're working on a long document with lots of headings, you may want to add a table of contents to help your readers and collaborators easily skim the page’s content and easily jump to any section.

Chunk 198:
In a table of contents, you’ll see a list of all the headings used in your page. H2s and H3s will be indented to reflect your page’s structure. Click on any of the headings in your table of contents to go to that heading in the page.
 A table of contents can appear in a page in two ways:
• At the top of your page, as a block.
• At the right side of your page as you scroll through it, as a page-level setting.

FAQs
 Why can't I see columns on my phone or tablet?

Chunk 202:
Unfortunately, our mobile apps don't support multiple columns yet, but it's definitely on our to-do list!
 Will my table of contents show titles of in-line tables on my page?
 No. Even if you give your table a name in your document, this won't be reflected in the table of contents. You can, however, add a heading above the database that will appear.
 If I turn individual headings a color, will that show in my table of contents?
 Your table of contents will always be all one color 🖌You can change this color, and it will will apply to the whole thing. To do this:
• Click the ⋮⋮ icon that appears when you hover over your table of contents. Or select it and hit cmd/ctrl + /. Or right click.

Chunk 203:
• Choose Color from the menu that pops up and select which color or highlight you want.

FAQs

Chunk 225:
Can I make Full width my default? Is there a way to set a default style for all pages?
 Not yet, but a lot of users have asked for this! We're continuing to keep this in mind for future projects.
 Can I justify text to be center aligned or right aligned?
 Notion doesn't have any traditional alignment options at the moment, unfortunately 😕But you can still make this happen. Drag and drop an empty line into the column next to your text to align it to the right or left.
 Why can't I change text size on mobile?
 This styling option, along with page width, only exists on desktop and web.
 What's the ideal size and aspect ratio for cover images?

Chunk 226:
The cover images are dynamic depending on the width of your window, so there's no specific size that works best. That said, we recommend using images at least 1,500 pixels wide.
 How can I insert an emoji in-line with my text 🤔?
 Anywhere in your text, type : followed by the name of the emoji you want to use, like :fire for 🔥 or :clappingfor 👏
 You can also use your system emoji picker to include emojis in-line on a Notion page, or anywhere else on your computer!
 Mac: ctrl + cmd + space
 Windows 10: windows key + . or windows key + ;

Databases are collections of Notion pages that help you organize information in a variety of ways. With multiple database views to choose from, you control how to display and search your content.
Intro to databases

Chunk 236:
Databases in Notion are collections of pages. Here, we'll introduce you to the general structure of a database, walk you through the different menus and options, and deep dive into how to open and edit pages within a database. 🗃
Views, filters & sorts
 You can view the same database in multiple ways, and switch back and forth between them depending on your needs. Within a view, you can add filters and sorts to easily categorize your content 📁
Database properties
 Database properties add all kinds of context to your database items, like due dates, task owners, relevant URLs, last edited timestamps, and more. Use these properties to filter, sort, and search your data 🧩
Relations & rollups

Chunk 237:
Have you ever wanted to connect the data between two tables? You're in luck! Notion's relation property is designed to help you express useful relationships between items in different databases 🛠
Customize your database
 Tailor your database to your needs with lots of customization options to choose from ✨
Database templates
 Most databases contain the same types of pages created over and over again. Think of weekly meeting notes, bug reports, or design specs. To make this easy, database templates let you define and replicate certain page structures with one click 🖨
Database automations
 Improve your efficiency by automating the most tedious parts of your work 🔁
Intro to formulas

Chunk 238:
In a Notion database, you can add a formula property that lets you run all kinds of calculations and functions based on other properties. You can use formulas to manipulate existing data and arrive at many other helpful values 🔮
Formula syntax & functions
 Notion formulas can operate on various properties and functions. Here, you'll find a list of them ➗
Sub-items & dependencies
 Use sub-items and dependencies to give depth to any workflow 🐣
Task databases & sprints
 Help your team stay on track with task databases and sprints 💪
Data sources & linked databases
 Need to reference database content somewhere else in your workspace? Linked databases let you show, filter, and sort the same source data across multiple locations ⛓

Chunk 239:
Optimize database load times & performance
 Here’s how to make sure your databases are always feeling quick and snappy 🏃🏼
Table view
 A table is the classic database view, but tables in Notion are more than just rows and columns. Each row opens up into its own page, and can contain whatever properties you want 📊
Board view
 Boards are helpful for showing items in a database moving through stages of a process, or grouped by property. Use them for project management and visualizing your data 📋
Timeline view
 For anyone who needs to visualize their projects plotted chronologically - whether it's hours, years, or anything in between - Notion's timeline is a type of database that keeps you on task and on track ⏳
Calendar view

Chunk 240:
Calendars let you visualize how database items connect to certain dates. Use one when you want a bird's-eye view for important launch dates, multi-day events, or even projects spanning multiple months 🗓️
List view
 Lists are simple and minimalist database views. They're ideal for storing notes, articles, and documents that don't need too many properties. Every item in a list is a page that can be opened with one click and store as much content as you need 📜
Gallery view
 Gallery view is the best way to display databases with visual components, like mood boards, office directories, virtual recipe boxes, and more 🖼️
Chart view

Chunk 241:
Charts help visualize the vast amount of information in your database. Customize your charts so you can see your data in the way that’s most helpful. You can even put charts from multiple databases into a Notion page to create a powerful dashboard 📊
Unique ID
 Add an extra layer of project management by giving your tasks their own IDs 🤖

Have you ever wanted to connect the data between two tables? You're in luck! Notion's relation property is designed to help you express useful relationships between items in different databases 🛠
Customize your database
 Tailor your database to your needs with lots of customization options to choose from ✨
Database templates
 Most databases contain the same types of pages created over and over again. Think of weekly meeting notes, bug reports, or design specs. To make this easy, database templates let you define and replicate certain page structures with one click 🖨
Database automations
 Improve your efficiency by automating the most tedious parts of your work 🔁
Intro to formulas

Chunk 247:
In a Notion database, you can add a formula property that lets you run all kinds of calculations and functions based on other properties. You can use formulas to manipulate existing data and arrive at many other helpful values 🔮
Formula syntax & functions
 Notion formulas can operate on various properties and functions. Here, you'll find a list of them ➗
Sub-items & dependencies
 Use sub-items and dependencies to give depth to any workflow 🐣
Task databases & sprints
 Help your team stay on track with task databases and sprints 💪
Data sources & linked databases
 Need to reference database content somewhere else in your workspace? Linked databases let you show, filter, and sort the same source data across multiple locations ⛓

Chunk 248:
Optimize database load times & performance
 Here’s how to make sure your databases are always feeling quick and snappy 🏃🏼
Table view
 A table is the classic database view, but tables in Notion are more than just rows and columns. Each row opens up into its own page, and can contain whatever properties you want 📊
Board view
 Boards are helpful for showing items in a database moving through stages of a process, or grouped by property. Use them for project management and visualizing your data 📋
Timeline view
 For anyone who needs to visualize their projects plotted chronologically - whether it's hours, years, or anything in between - Notion's timeline is a type of database that keeps you on task and on track ⏳
Calendar view

Chunk 249:
Calendars let you visualize how database items connect to certain dates. Use one when you want a bird's-eye view for important launch dates, multi-day events, or even projects spanning multiple months 🗓️
List view
 Lists are simple and minimalist database views. They're ideal for storing notes, articles, and documents that don't need too many properties. Every item in a list is a page that can be opened with one click and store as much content as you need 📜
Gallery view
 Gallery view is the best way to display databases with visual components, like mood boards, office directories, virtual recipe boxes, and more 🖼️
Chart view

Chunk 250:
Charts help visualize the vast amount of information in your database. Customize your charts so you can see your data in the way that’s most helpful. You can even put charts from multiple databases into a Notion page to create a powerful dashboard 📊
Unique ID
 Add an extra layer of project management by giving your tasks their own IDs 🤖

Databases in Notion are collections of pages. Here, we'll introduce you to the general structure of a database, walk you through the different menus and options, and deep dive into how to open and edit pages within a database. 🗃

Chunk 254:
• Create a database
• Full page vs. inline databases
• Add and open database pages
• Item options
• Collaborating in a database
• "Can edit content" permission level
• Lock views
 There are three things that make Notion databases unique:
 Every item is its own page: Every item you enter into your database is a Notion page. Open a database item to add more information in the form of text, images, and more, as you would with any other Notion page!
 You can customize properties: Add properties to contextualize, label, and augment any database item with things like dates, status, and links. Learn more about database properties here →

Chunk 255:
You can toggle between multiple views: Your data isn't limited to a table. Visualize the information in a database as a list, calendar, chart, and more — whatever makes the information most useful. Learn more about views, filters, and sorts here →
A tour of databases
 Every full page database has the same menus and sets of options. Here's a quick walkthrough.
 Views: Edit and switch between all the different views of your database. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view to see your other views.

Chunk 256:
Add a new view: Add a new view to your database, with its own layout, filters and sorts. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and select Add view.
 Filter menu: Apply filters based on property values. When you apply a filter to a database, only you can see it to start, but you can save them to the view for your entire shared team if you prefer!
 Sort menu: Sort your data by a property. Like filters, sorts are only visible to you by default, but you can make them visible to your whole team as well.
 Database search: Type in any word, whether it's in the name of a database item or in a property, and your database will only show items that fit that search query.

Chunk 257:
•
•
• menu: Located at the top right of your database, this allows you to edit your view layout, grouping, properties, and more.
 Create a new database page: Click this to add a new page to your database. Depending on your screen size, this may appear as + or New. Open the dropdown next to this button to access and edit any database templates you've configured.
Create a database
 To create a database in Notion, open a new or existing Notion page and type / followed by the type of database view you’d like to start with, like table or board.
 When you create a database, you can start from scratch or pull in data from another part of your workspace.

Chunk 258:
• If you want to use the same properties or an existing view of a database, we suggest selecting an existing data source. Search for an existing database and then choose the one you'd like to use.
• If the information you're adding to the database doesn’t exist anywhere else in your workspace, we suggest creating a new data source.

Customize database pages
 The top section of any page in a Notion database can include several things:

Chunk 269:
Properties provide data about the page you're looking at, like project owner, due date, tags, and more.
 Comments capture conversation between you and your teammates. You can use them to tag each other, ask questions, provide feedback and more.
 Backlinks indicate all the pages that link to the current page so you can easily navigate between them.
 As with everything in Notion, you can customize the look and feel of these components. To access these options:
 Click the
•
•
• at the top right of any Notion page in a database and select Customize page.
 For properties, you can use this menu to choose which property fields you want to show at the top of the page, and how. For each one, select from:

Chunk 270:
• Always show: Nothing changes, you continue to see the property field.
• Hide when empty:  The property field will disappear from the top of your page if it has no value in it.
• Always hide: The property field will not show up at the top of your page.
 Always show: Nothing changes, you continue to see the property field.
 Hide when empty:  The property field will disappear from the top of your page if it has no value in it.
 Always hide: The property field will not show up at the top of your page.
 You can also access the Customize page menu by clicking the ⋮⋮ icon next to any property in the list at the top of your database page. This ⋮⋮ icon can also be clicked and dragged up or down to reorder how properties are displayed on your page.

Chunk 271:
Tip: If you have a database with dozens of properties, hiding some properties is a great way to keep your pages clear.
 Note: When you hide properties, they get aggregated in a single menu item at the bottom of the list. You can click this to easily show any hidden properties.
 For backlinks, you can choose:
• Expanded: See all the pages that link to the current page listed in full.
• Show in popover: In case you don't want to see all the pages, you can choose to see just the number of backlinks. Click to open a popup displaying all the pages.
• Off:  Just hide all backlinks entirely.
 Expanded: See all the pages that link to the current page listed in full.

Collaborating in a database
 When using a database in a shared workspace, Notion has features in place to prevent accidental edits that could impact other teammates.
"Can edit content" permission level

Chunk 273:
Click Share at the top of a database to see and manage all users' permission levels. Learn more about sharing and permissions here →
 The Can edit content permission level is only found on database pages, and allows users to:
• Create, edit, and delete pages within the database.
• Edit property values for those pages.
 Create, edit, and delete pages within the database.
 Edit property values for those pages.
 Users with Can edit content permissions in a database will not be able to:
• Add, edit, or remove database properties or views.
• Change filters or sorts.
• Lock or unlock the database.
 Add, edit, or remove database properties or views.
 Change filters or sorts.
 Lock or unlock the database.

Chunk 274:
Note: Users with Can edit content access will still be able to create linked databases and edit views, sorts, and filters in that linked database. Learn more about linked databases →
Lock views
 Find this option in the
•
•
• menu at the very top right of the Notion window. Switch it on to prevent anyone from changing properties and views in your database. They'll still be able to edit the data it contains.
 Note that anyone with editing access can toggle this lock on or off at any time. This is helpful as a quick safeguard against accidental edits in a database that you'd like many people to be able to change structurally.

Types of database views
 There are six different ways to visualize your content within a database. Here's a high level overview of each layout:
• Table: Tables allow you to see your database pages as rows, with every property represented by a column.
• Board: This view groups your items by property. For example, you could use it as a Kanban board to move tasks from one status to another as you make progress on them.

Chunk 279:
• Timeline: Use your database to plot project milestones on a timeline so you can see when they’re happening and how long they’ll take to complete.
• Calendar: Calendar view displays your items based on their Date property.
• List: Lists are a very clean, minimal layout of your database items.
• Gallery: This view is useful for highlighting images. You can edit your gallery to show images contained in the Files & media property — otherwise, the gallery will show any content that the database page contains.
• Chart: This view visualizes your database items in a bar, line, or donut chart so you can easily analyze and report on the data.

Chunk 281:
Chart: This view visualizes your database items in a bar, line, or donut chart so you can easily analyze and report on the data.
Create and switch between views
 When you first create a database, you'll need to choose the layout of the default view. After this, you can create a new view by selecting + next to your existing views. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and select Add view.
 You can also provide others with information by giving your view a description. To do this:
 Select a view → Edit view.
 Select ⓘ next to your view’s name, then enter your description.
 When you hover over a view, you will see its description.

Chunk 282:
You can reorder your views by dragging them. If you have a lot of views, you can select {#} more... next to your views to do this.
 In your sidebar, views show up as nested items inside any full page database. You can tell they are views because they'll have a
• to their left. Click on any view in your sidebar to jump right to it.
Customize your database views
 When you’re in a given view, click its name to rename, duplicate, delete, copy its link, or edit its components. You can also edit view components by clicking the
•
•
• at the top right of the database.
 Each view of the database has several components that you can customize:
• Layout: Choose how you want your database to be visually organized.

Chunk 283:
• Properties: Show or hide database properties for each view.
• Filters: Add criteria based on property values to show or hide data.
• Sorts: Sort by a property to change the order that pages are displayed in.
• Groups: Group your data by the values in a property.

 Properties: Show or hide database properties for each view.
 Filters: Add criteria based on property values to show or hide data.
 Sorts: Sort by a property to change the order that pages are displayed in.

Link to your database view
 You can copy an anchor link to this specific view of your database so you can share it elsewhere.

Chunk 284:
Click the
•
•
• icon at the top right of your table.
 Click Copy link to {view} and the URL will copy to your clipboard so you can paste it.
Open pages as
 Within each view, you can choose how you'd like database pages to open. There are three options:
• Side peek: Open pages on the right side of the database. The rest of the database view continues to be interactive on the left.
• Center peek: Open pages in a focused, center modal.
• Full page: Open pages as full pages directly.
 Side peek: Open pages on the right side of the database. The rest of the database view continues to be interactive on the left.

•
•
• at the top right of your database, and open the Layout menu.
 Scroll down and change the Open pages in setting.
 Note: Table, Board, List & Timeline layouts will open pages in side peek by default. Gallery & Calendar layouts will open pages in center peek by default.
Filters
 Notion makes it easy to filter your database so it only displays the items that meet specified criteria, i.e. have (or don't have) certain properties. These filters can be as simple or complex as you like!
Add a filter
 To filter the entries you see in a database view:
 Click Filter at the top of your database.
 In the dropdown that appears, choose the property you'd like to filter by.

Chunk 286:
This filter will now show up at the top of your database. Click the filter icon to see and edit all of the filters that have been applied to your database.
 Add another filter by clicking the filter icon. You can have as many filters as you'd like!
 Note: In a shared database, any changes you make to filters and sorts in views won’t affect other people on the team until you click Save for everyone.
Add an advanced filter
 You can create more specific database views and combine AND and OR logic by using filter groups. These can be nested up to three layers deep! Here's how:
 Click the filter icon at the top of your database → Add advanced filter.

Chunk 287:
A new menu will pop up. Here, you can choose the properties that you'd like to filter by, and customize the AND and OR logic of the advanced filter.
 In the example below, we're filtering the table view of our Roadmap so that all the entries have to meet the criteria that include both AND and OR logic.
 Tip: You can quickly turn a filter into a filter group by clicking the
•
•
• to the right of the filter, and selecting Add to advanced filter.
Sorts
 You can sort your database so that items are displayed based on properties appearing in ascending or descending order.
 For example, you can order them based on priority, or last edited, or alphabetically.
 Click ⇅ at the top of your database.

Chunk 288:
In the dropdown that appears, choose the property you'd like to sort by.
 This sort will now show up at the top of your database. Click to edit it.
 You can add as many sorts as you want, or remove them by clicking the X to their right.
 Change the order that multiple sorts are applied by dragging them up or down using ⋮⋮.
 Note: Different properties sort by different logic, depending on their value type.
• Text properties such as Name and Text sort alphabetically.
• Number properties sort numerically.
• For Select and Multi-select properties, you get to define what sorting order means. Click on the property, then drag options up or down to set the sort order.
 Text properties such as Name and Text sort alphabetically.

Chunk 289:
Number properties sort numerically.
 For Select and Multi-select properties, you get to define what sorting order means. Click on the property, then drag options up or down to set the sort order.
Groups
 You can group your database by different properties on your table to visualize them in different ways.
 Click the
•
•
• menu and find Group. You can group by nearly any property type.
 The database will now group by values of that property. Each group includes a 👁️ to the left, so you can quickly hide groups and focus on what you need.
 You can sort your database groups by selecting Sort and choosing to sort manually or sort by the options provided (alphabetical, ascending, and more).

Chunk 290:
Empty groups can also be hidden from view with the Hide empty groups toggle.
Search your database
 You can search for specific content in your database.
 Click 🔎 at the top right and type the word(s) you're looking for in page titles or properties.
 You'll see your database change in real-time to only show the items that fit that criteria.
Freeze column
 If you have a large database, it's probably tedious to keep moving back and forth between properties to compare their data.
 Instead you can freeze one column, which will cause it to stay visible on the left side no matter where you scroll in the database.
 To freeze a column, click the name of the column and click Freeze up to column.

Chunk 291:
To unfreeze a column, click the name of the column and click Unfreeze column.

Database buttons
 Database buttons automate your workflows so you don’t have to spend as much time manually updating your database. For example, you could use a button to approve a document or mark a daily habit as complete. Buttons can be added to your database as a property, and when a button is clicked, it’ll take actions on database pages so you don’t have to.
 To add a database button property:

Chunk 298:
Select
•
•
• at the top right of your database → Properties → New property → Button.
 Add a label for your button, like Approve or Complete.
 Add an action for your button. This is the action you want to have taken when the button is selected. Multiple actions can be taken using one button. You can select from:
• Add page to...: This will add a page to a database of your choice.
• Edit pages in...: This will edit properties for pages in a database of your choice.
• Show confirmation: This will show a message to the person who has selected the button before any further action is taken. You could pair this with another action so that you can be more careful with edits made to your database.

Chunk 299:
• Open page: This will open a page from a database of your choice. You can also decide how the page will open on the screen.
• Send Slack notification to...: This will send a Slack notification to the Slack channel of your choosing.
 Add page to...: This will add a page to a database of your choice.
 Edit pages in...: This will edit properties for pages in a database of your choice.

Database automations
 Improve your efficiency by automating the most tedious parts of your work 🔁
Intro to formulas

Chunk 317:
In a Notion database, you can add a formula property that lets you run all kinds of calculations and functions based on other properties. You can use formulas to manipulate existing data and arrive at many other helpful values 🔮
Formula syntax & functions
 Notion formulas can operate on various properties and functions. Here, you'll find a list of them ➗
Sub-items & dependencies
 Use sub-items and dependencies to give depth to any workflow 🐣
Task databases & sprints
 Help your team stay on track with task databases and sprints 💪
Data sources & linked databases

Chunk 318:
Optimize database load times & performance
 Here’s how to make sure your databases are always feeling quick and snappy 🏃🏼
Table view
 A table is the classic database view, but tables in Notion are more than just rows and columns. Each row opens up into its own page, and can contain whatever properties you want 📊
Board view
 Boards are helpful for showing items in a database moving through stages of a process, or grouped by property. Use them for project management and visualizing your data 📋
Timeline view
 For anyone who needs to visualize their projects plotted chronologically - whether it's hours, years, or anything in between - Notion's timeline is a type of database that keeps you on task and on track ⏳
Calendar view

Chunk 319:
Calendars let you visualize how database items connect to certain dates. Use one when you want a bird's-eye view for important launch dates, multi-day events, or even projects spanning multiple months 🗓️
List view
 Lists are simple and minimalist database views. They're ideal for storing notes, articles, and documents that don't need too many properties. Every item in a list is a page that can be opened with one click and store as much content as you need 📜
Gallery view
 Gallery view is the best way to display databases with visual components, like mood boards, office directories, virtual recipe boxes, and more 🖼️
Chart view

Chunk 320:
Charts help visualize the vast amount of information in your database. Customize your charts so you can see your data in the way that’s most helpful. You can even put charts from multiple databases into a Notion page to create a powerful dashboard 📊

AI connectors let you  find and create content using info from third-party apps (like Slack and Google Drive) within Notion. Learn how they can boost your organization's efficiency, enhance overall productivity, and even reduce spend on AI tools.

Chunk 325:
In an ideal world, your team's knowledge would be neatly organized in one place, regularly updated, and consistently shared across teams. However, for most organizations, this "work about work" often falls to the bottom of the priority list.
 Teams are whisked away by a need to respond here, attend a meeting there, and by the end of the day, they’re drained, and vital knowledge remains scattered and disorganized across tools. While AI chatbots offer promises to speed up our work, they both lack crucial company context and exist in a separate digital space, limiting their usefulness.
 Notion is the first tool to combine your company’s knowledge — across multiple tools — right alongside the rest of your work.

Chunk 326:
Search across tools with AI connectors
 When you integrate Slack or Google Drive with Notion AI, you can ask questions and receive relevant information from these connected sources. Notion AI will provide answers and cite the specific references it used, allowing you to access knowledge across multiple platforms seamlessly.
 Notion AI can keep up with Slack discussions, remember every Google Slides presentation, and be accessed with the press of a button — inside Notion, or globally with the shortcut Shift + Cmd + J.
 Here’s how this might show up in your day-to day work:

Chunk 327:
• Get up-to-date project updates, without a meeting —Try asking Notion AI to “Catch me up on Project Albatross and identify blockers.” It will check your project tracker in Notion, and double-check with your decisions mentioned in Slack — citing its sources so you can jump in wherever needed.
• Facilitate better new hire onboarding —New hires have a lot of questions, it’s literally their job to learn! With Notion AI, they can self-serve answers from all of your tools, and therefore trust it’s gathering the full picture. For more inspiration, see how Notion customer dbt Labs used AI to improve teamwork and efficiency.

Chunk 328:
• Access your knowledge from anywhere —The last thing you want to do when you’re on the go is search through multiple apps to find the answer to a simple question — or bug your colleagues when you know you could find it yourself. Notion AI is here to help troubleshoot common issues, wherever you need it.

Everything you have access to — and nothing else

Chunk 330:
AI connectors respect permissions, so people in your Notion workspace will only see content they already have access to in the connected tools. In other words, it won't reveal anything you're not supposed to see. We've designed this with security in mind, adhering to user permissions both in the original apps and in Notion.
 When you ask Notion AI a question it can’t answer, it will let you know, and provide some thought starters using world knowledge.

Transforming your organization with AI connectors

Chunk 331:
AI connectors are powerful tools that bridge the gap between Notion and your other workplace applications. These connectors allow Notion's AI to access and utilize information from various sources, creating a more comprehensive and efficient workflow. Here's a deeper look at how AI connectors enhance team’s day to day:
• Reduce time spent searching— On average, workers spend 3 hours a day* searching for information (*Check out the Notion AI ROI template to learn more) . This wasted time can hinder productivity and innovation. AI connectors transform Notion into a centralized information hub, saving up to 10 minutes per question asked, enabling teams to make faster, more informed decisions.

Chunk 332:
• Tap in to otherwise unused knowledge—Too often, valuable ideas are buried deep in Slack threads, intended to be shared later but ultimately forgotten to time. Notion AI has the capability to recall that knowledge right when you need it, maximizing the creative impact of your team’s innovation. It can also cite useful information you didn't even know you had (like a new update from your company's all-hands presentation that pairs well with the report you're working on).

Chunk 333:
• Maintain focus and productivity— Context switching between apps can disrupt your workflow and burden you with distracting messages and notifications. With AI seamlessly integrated into Notion, you can access the information you need without breaking your concentration, allowing you to stay in a productive flow state as long as you need.
• Consolidate your tool stack— Just like other work software, most AI tools are made up of a set of fundamental actions (we’ve been saying this for years). Notion AI is designed with these building blocks in mind. That means it doesn’t just allow you to search other tools; but it’s also your team’s chatbot, writing partner, and so much more — so you don’t have to juggle dozens of apps to get work done.

Getting started with AI Connector for Slack

Chunk 338:
We sometimes say Slack is like the other half of Notion. If all of your permanent docs live inside Notion, then all of your ephemeral conversations happen in Slack. By connecting Slack to Notion, you can bridge the gap between these two crucial communication channels. This integration allows you to seamlessly search and reference Slack conversations directly within Notion, ensuring that no important information slips through the cracks.
 Here’s just a few ways we see the Slack connector show up in teams’ workflows:
• Write smarter status reports— Project managers responsible for writing a daily or weekly status report will appreciate the ability to ask Notion AI to note everything that’s happened in a certain time period.

Chunk 339:
• Summarize rambling threads— Extracting insights from threads in Slack can be tedious, but with Notion AI connected to Slack, you can simply ask to gather all ideas related to a certain project and insert them into the document.
• Keep track of critical announcements—Try using Notion AI to gather context before diving into a brand new doc. You might be surprised what you find, and how it stops you from going down the wrong path. Ask Notion AI to quickly summarize long Slack conversations into easy-to-read summaries.

Getting started with AI Connector for Google Docs, Sheets and Slides

Chunk 341:
Google Drive is a vital hub for many teams, housing essential documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. By connecting it to Notion, you're bringing this wealth of information directly into your workflow.
 With the Google Drive connector, Notion AI can quickly reference key data from Google Documents, Slides or Sheets without switching apps or even compile research from various Google Docs into your Notion projects.
 Here’s just a few ways we see the Google Drive connector show up in teams’ workflows:

Chunk 342:
• Bring formal messaging into your docs— Your teams may work in Notion, but you likely have a slide library elsewhere with your formal pitches, all-hands presentations, and more. This form of information sharing can be really helpful to individuals trying to succinctly capture and share context ahead of a project.
• Access legacy knowledge— If you’ve largely switched off of google docs but haven’t imported everything over to Notion, an AI connector can help bridge the gap. This way, you have access to the information you need, but only when you need it.

Chunk 343:
• Improve sharing across teams— Some teams' work requires them to stay in other tools. For instance, your legal team might work primarily in Google Docs for contract drafting. The Google Drive connector allows other teams to easily reference key terms in Notion without disrupting the legal team's workflow, ensuring everyone has access to the latest information.

Chunk 350:
In an ideal world, your team's knowledge would be neatly organized in one place, regularly updated, and consistently shared across teams. However, for most organizations, this "work about work" often falls to the bottom of the priority list.
 Teams are whisked away by a need to respond here, attend a meeting there, and by the end of the day, they’re drained, and vital knowledge remains scattered and disorganized across tools. While AI chatbots offer promises to speed up our work, they both lack crucial company context and exist in a separate digital space, limiting their usefulness.
 Notion is the first tool to combine your company’s knowledge — across multiple tools — right alongside the rest of your work.

Chunk 351:
Search across tools with AI connectors
 When you integrate Slack or Google Drive with Notion AI, you can ask questions and receive relevant information from these connected sources. Notion AI will provide answers and cite the specific references it used, allowing you to access knowledge across multiple platforms seamlessly.
 Notion AI can keep up with Slack discussions, remember every Google Slides presentation, and be accessed with the press of a button — inside Notion, or globally with the shortcut Shift + Cmd + J.
 Here’s how this might show up in your day-to day work:

Chunk 352:
• Get up-to-date project updates, without a meeting —Try asking Notion AI to “Catch me up on Project Albatross and identify blockers.” It will check your project tracker in Notion, and double-check with your decisions mentioned in Slack — citing its sources so you can jump in wherever needed.
• Facilitate better new hire onboarding —New hires have a lot of questions, it’s literally their job to learn! With Notion AI, they can self-serve answers from all of your tools, and therefore trust it’s gathering the full picture. For more inspiration, see how Notion customer dbt Labs used AI to improve teamwork and efficiency.

Chunk 353:
• Access your knowledge from anywhere —The last thing you want to do when you’re on the go is search through multiple apps to find the answer to a simple question — or bug your colleagues when you know you could find it yourself. Notion AI is here to help troubleshoot common issues, wherever you need it.

Everything you have access to — and nothing else

Chunk 355:
AI connectors respect permissions, so people in your Notion workspace will only see content they already have access to in the connected tools. In other words, it won't reveal anything you're not supposed to see. We've designed this with security in mind, adhering to user permissions both in the original apps and in Notion.
 When you ask Notion AI a question it can’t answer, it will let you know, and provide some thought starters using world knowledge.

Transforming your organization with AI connectors

Chunk 356:
AI connectors are powerful tools that bridge the gap between Notion and your other workplace applications. These connectors allow Notion's AI to access and utilize information from various sources, creating a more comprehensive and efficient workflow. Here's a deeper look at how AI connectors enhance team’s day to day:
• Reduce time spent searching— On average, workers spend 3 hours a day* searching for information (*Check out the Notion AI ROI template to learn more) . This wasted time can hinder productivity and innovation. AI connectors transform Notion into a centralized information hub, saving up to 10 minutes per question asked, enabling teams to make faster, more informed decisions.

Chunk 357:
• Tap in to otherwise unused knowledge—Too often, valuable ideas are buried deep in Slack threads, intended to be shared later but ultimately forgotten to time. Notion AI has the capability to recall that knowledge right when you need it, maximizing the creative impact of your team’s innovation. It can also cite useful information you didn't even know you had (like a new update from your company's all-hands presentation that pairs well with the report you're working on).

Chunk 358:
• Maintain focus and productivity— Context switching between apps can disrupt your workflow and burden you with distracting messages and notifications. With AI seamlessly integrated into Notion, you can access the information you need without breaking your concentration, allowing you to stay in a productive flow state as long as you need.
• Consolidate your tool stack— Just like other work software, most AI tools are made up of a set of fundamental actions (we’ve been saying this for years). Notion AI is designed with these building blocks in mind. That means it doesn’t just allow you to search other tools; but it’s also your team’s chatbot, writing partner, and so much more — so you don’t have to juggle dozens of apps to get work done.

Getting started with AI Connector for Slack

Chunk 363:
We sometimes say Slack is like the other half of Notion. If all of your permanent docs live inside Notion, then all of your ephemeral conversations happen in Slack. By connecting Slack to Notion, you can bridge the gap between these two crucial communication channels. This integration allows you to seamlessly search and reference Slack conversations directly within Notion, ensuring that no important information slips through the cracks.
 Here’s just a few ways we see the Slack connector show up in teams’ workflows:
• Write smarter status reports— Project managers responsible for writing a daily or weekly status report will appreciate the ability to ask Notion AI to note everything that’s happened in a certain time period.

Chunk 364:
• Summarize rambling threads— Extracting insights from threads in Slack can be tedious, but with Notion AI connected to Slack, you can simply ask to gather all ideas related to a certain project and insert them into the document.
• Keep track of critical announcements—Try using Notion AI to gather context before diving into a brand new doc. You might be surprised what you find, and how it stops you from going down the wrong path. Ask Notion AI to quickly summarize long Slack conversations into easy-to-read summaries.

Getting started with AI Connector for Google Docs, Sheets and Slides

Chunk 366:
Google Drive is a vital hub for many teams, housing essential documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. By connecting it to Notion, you're bringing this wealth of information directly into your workflow.
 With the Google Drive connector, Notion AI can quickly reference key data from Google Documents, Slides or Sheets without switching apps or even compile research from various Google Docs into your Notion projects.
 Here’s just a few ways we see the Google Drive connector show up in teams’ workflows:

Chunk 367:
• Bring formal messaging into your docs— Your teams may work in Notion, but you likely have a slide library elsewhere with your formal pitches, all-hands presentations, and more. This form of information sharing can be really helpful to individuals trying to succinctly capture and share context ahead of a project.
• Access legacy knowledge— If you’ve largely switched off of google docs but haven’t imported everything over to Notion, an AI connector can help bridge the gap. This way, you have access to the information you need, but only when you need it.

Chunk 368:
• Improve sharing across teams— Some teams' work requires them to stay in other tools. For instance, your legal team might work primarily in Google Docs for contract drafting. The Google Drive connector allows other teams to easily reference key terms in Notion without disrupting the legal team's workflow, ensuring everyone has access to the latest information.

It can also find useful information you didn't even know you had (like a nifty stat from your company's all-hands presentation that pairs well with the report you're working on). It's like having a smart helper that knows where all your work knowledge is hidden!

 Explore knowledge beyond your workspace

Chunk 470:
Notion AI can provide answers that extend beyond your Notion workspace, using world knowledge from cutting-edge language models like GPT-4 and Claude. For example, you could ask, "What are some effective ways to request a promotion?" or "Suggest 10 creative marketing ideas for our protein powder targeting Gen Z in Q4." Then, continue the conversation to refine these ideas into something valuable for you.
Analyze files and images
 Notion AI can do more than just work with text. It can tackle various file types, including PDFs and images. This helps you quickly make sense of information from different places.
 Here are a few ways you can use Notion AI to analyze files and images:

Chunk 471:
• Understand documents better— Ask Notion AI to help with your files. For example, try asking, "What are the main points from this Q3 sales report PDF? Can you suggest three things we should do?" Notion AI will quickly read the document, pick out the important information, and give you a short summary with actionable advice.Upload or drag and drop PDF files into Notion AI chat to analyze their contents.

Chunk 472:
• Improve designs— Use Notion AI to look at images. For instance, show it a picture of your product packaging and ask, "How can we make this design look better on store shelves? Give me three ideas." Notion AI will look at the image and suggest improvements based on good design practices and what's popular now.Upload or drag images into Notion AI, then ask AI to analyze the image contents.

Notion AI will look at the image and suggest improvements based on good design practices and what's popular now.
 Notion AI can only analyze files and images you directly upload to the chat. It can't access files or images already on your Notion pages. So if you want Notion AI to take a look, make sure to upload them when you ask for help.
Access information across your integrated apps like Slack & Google Drive

Chunk 474:
Notion AI can search beyond just your Notion workspace. It can find information in other connected apps too, giving you a complete search experience across all your integrated work tools. While generic AI tools often struggle to produce high-quality results due to a lack of context, Notion AI keeps up with Slack discussions, tracks every project, and remembers every Google Slides presentation.
 The best part? Notion AI doesn't just help you remember things you've forgotten. It can also find useful information you didn't even know you had (like a nifty stat from your company's all-hands presentation that pairs well with the report you're working on). It's like having a smart helper that knows where all your work knowledge is hidden!

Chunk 475:
Let's explore how Notion AI can be your go-to source for information:
• Slack connector— Notion AI can search through your Slack channels and direct messages to find relevant information. For example, if you ask "What was the final decision on the product launch date?", Notion AI can scan recent Slack conversations and provide you with the most up-to-date information.

Chunk 476:
• Google Docs, Sheets & Slides Connector — Notion AI can access and search through your connected Google Workspace documents. For instance, if you ask "What were the key points from our latest product presentation?", Notion AI can look into your Google Slides to find and summarize the main ideas from your most recent product deck.Select Google Drive from the Notion AI source picker to narrow your search scope.

 Notion AI only shows you information from places you can access. And don't worry – Notion keeps your data safe and sound. We never use it for AI training.
Limit your search to trusted knowledge sources
 Sometimes you know exactly where to find information, but need a hand parsing through it quickly. You can ask Notion AI to look in specific sources for more precise answers. This means you can zero in on one particular area instead of sifting through everything connected to Notion.

Chunk 479:
Let's say you're a customer service agent helping a customer who's facing account login issues. All your team's CX macros live inside your team's Customer Support knowledge hub, but you're pressed for time and can't spot the procedure to troubleshoot the problem.
 Here's how you can quickly ask Notion AI to do the heavy lifting for you:
 Look for the All sources option at the bottom of your Notion AI chat box.
 Click on All sources to unfurl a dropdown menu.
 Choose CX Knowledge Base from the dropdown to narrow your search to your Customer Service knowledge hub.

Chunk 480:
Now, ask your specific question. For example: "What are the steps to troubleshoot common login issues?" Notion AI will then search only within your knowledge hub for the relevant steps. You can even take it a step further and ask Notion AI to draft an email response you can send straight to your customer.
 Pro tip: Use "@" mentions to get even more specific
 Want to drill down to a specific page within your knowledge hub? Simply mention it in your question. For example, ask Notion AI "Check the '@Customer Access Issues Manual' for the steps to help this customer with login troubles?"
Leverage a more powerful writing Notion AI

Chunk 481:
Notion AI now comes with more powerful writing capabilities. It can tap into your workspace and the wider world to help you create high-quality content, brainstorm ideas, draft documents, and even reformat pages based on templates. Think of it as your on-demand copy reviewer and editor that not only captures your ideas but also helps organize and refine them into a clear, structured format.
 Pro tip: Refine as you go
 Don't worry about getting it perfect on the first try. You can always ask Notion AI to make tweaks or additions to your new page after it's created. It's all about iterating until you've got exactly what you need.
 Here are some ways you can use this powerful writing tool:

Chunk 482:
• Make your content follow a specific style guide— Let's say you're working on a press release and you want it to align with your content team's style guide.

Whether you need to track project timelines, analyze team performance, or simply make sense of large datasets, charts offer a solution that transforms your database pages into actionable information.

Chunk 492:
• Combine charts to create a dashboard
• 3 ways to use charts for your team
• Visualize what’s coming with your product roadmap
• Enhance your existing project management suite with charts
 With Notion’s connected workspace, you can get your projects to the finish line faster and with less context switching. But without visualizations, managing large amounts of tasks can be cumbersome. Charts take your project management to the next level, helping you to monitor project progress, spot trends, and make decisions.
 With Notion charts you can:

Chunk 493:
• Visualize your project in realtime — Forget about separate tools or tedious copy-pasting. When you add charts from Notion databases, they’ll update automatically whenever a change is made to the underlying data or tasks.
• Make more informed decisions — Looking at hundreds of tasks in a database can be overwhelming. Charts let you easily spot trends, monitor progress, and make decisions to move forward quicker than you might be able to otherwise.
• Break free from complicated analytics tools — We all love our data partners, but we’d prefer not to need them for absolutely everything. With charts, anyone can make beautiful visualizations in a few clicks using the UI they already know (and, hopefully, love!)

Chunk 495:
In this guide, we’ll cover how to make a chart, and discuss ways that you can use them to improve your project management in Notion.
How your database becomes a chart
 Charts work like any other database view — meaning you can view the same data in multiple ways, and switch back and forth between them depending on your needs. To create a view, simply navigate to the + button in your database and select “Chart.” Within your chart view, you can filter your data, and customize your chart to craft a perfect picture of your project’s progress.

 Notion charts come with 4 layout options, each serving a unique purpose:

Chunk 496:
• Donut charts for simple distribution — Donut charts are a simple option for visualizing the distribution of tasks across different categories or team members, providing a clear view of resource allocation. For example, you might use one to analyze and balance the task load across your engineering team in a given sprint.

Chunk 497:
• Horizontal and vertical bar charts for multi-dimensional categorization — Bar charts let you view database items with sub-groups, helping you quickly compare two categories, like status and task type. You might use a one of these to understand OKR progress by team and identify a bottleneck in your operating model.

Chunk 498:
• Line charts for progress over time — Line charts are best for tracking the progress of tasks over time, and can even be used to compare sub-groups. Like the number of pieces published each week in a given quarter, broken down by channel; or the number of tasks completed over time, by engineer.

Chunk 499:
As mentioned, you’ll also be able to sort and filter the data in your chart, add axis and data labels, and even customize your color palate. Learn more in the video below:
 Now that you’ve got the basics, let’s dive in to how charts help your work in the real world.
Combine charts to create a dashboard
 Since charts are database views, you can create them anywhere in Notion by navigating to the page where you want the view to appear and typing /chart. Here you’ll be prompted to link an existing database. Do this multiple times, and you’ll be able to make a dashboard that lets you visualize data from multiple databases, or from the same database (in multiple ways!) in a single place.

Chunk 500:
The beauty of Notion’s connected workspace means that unlike a chart created based on static data in a spreadsheet, these dashboards are living records of the work going on across your team, and they update in realtime. Use them for one database, or many. You might want to:
• Centralize scattered tracking systems — if you have teams working across different project trackers (like your engineering tasks, and marketing campaign calendar), consider creating a dashboard to visualize the status of both projects simultaneously.

Chunk 501:
• Get an in-depth view of important work — similarly, you might want to create a dashboard to view different cuts of the same database. Like an OKR dashboard that highlights different project statuses, key result progression, and tasks completed over time.
• Visualize team progress across projects — as a team manager, you could create a dashboard to understand individual performance, irrespective of project statuses. Here, you might look at tasks assigned to each of your reports, overall projects each team member is on, and more.

3 ways to use charts for your team
 So how can you use charts (and dashboards!), to enhance your work? Let’s consider three different kinds of projects that we commonly see managed inside of Notion.
Create an OKR dashboard for your leadership team

Chunk 504:
Charts help visualize OKRs, making it easier to track progress, enhance decision-making, and improve accountability. By analyzing trends and communicating goals clearly, teams can stay agile and keep leadership informed without creating an additional burden of reporting.
 You might consider creating a bar chart of OKR status by team to identify and mitigate potential risks. Similarly, a line chart of key result progress over time can help identify which teams have momentum, and those that might be slowing down.
Visualize what’s coming with your product roadmap

Chunk 505:
Charts offer a strategic view of your product roadmap, enabling your team to allocate resources efficiently and prioritize features with precision. By visualizing upcoming features and their timelines, you can ensure that your team stays on track and meets key milestones, ultimately leading to a more streamlined and effective development process.
Deepen understanding of your content library
 If you manage your content calendar in Notion, you can use charts to understand both in progress and published content at a glance.
 You might use a line chart track content scheduling and publishing to maintain a consistent release schedule. This helps identify delays or inconsistencies in your workflow.

Chunk 506:
At the same time, you can visualize content distribution by tagging pieces based on channel in a bar chart. This ensures that each audience segment receives the appropriate amount of content and could help you refactor plans to make sure all of your audience’s needs are met.
Enhance your existing project management suite with charts
 While this guide covered the bulk of what you need to know to get started, the possibilities for using charts are pretty endless, especially when combined with other project management features in Notion. Here are a few more advanced ways to use charts in your workspace:

Chunk 507:
• Turn synced databases into a chart — Synced databases pull information from tools like Jira, Asana, and Git Hub into your Notion workspace to let you visualize 3rd party tasks as a Notion database. Consider turning these synced databases into charts so that your project manager can get a view of what’s happening across all of these different tools in one glance.

Consider turning these synced databases into charts so that your project manager can get a view of what’s happening across all of these different tools in one glance.

Chunk 508:
• Visualize AI-generated content tags — With AI autofill, you can generate tags for every row in your database based on page content in seconds. Why not use charts to visualize those tags? This makes for quick exploration of large data sets with very little work to audit and tag your data in the first place.

Chunk 509:
• Embed charts from different data sources in your dashboard — You can embed charts from external data sources such as Tableau, Mixpanel, or Google Analytics into Notion. Add these alongside the charts you’re using for project tracking to create a comprehensive view of your team’s performance, without leaving the Notion app.

 Now that you’ve got the basics, let’s dive in to how charts help your work in the real world.
Combine charts to create a dashboard
 Since charts are database views, you can create them anywhere in Notion by navigating to the page where you want the view to appear and typing /chart. Here you’ll be prompted to link an existing database. Do this multiple times, and you’ll be able to make a dashboard that lets you visualize data from multiple databases, or from the same database (in multiple ways!) in a single place.

Chunk 523:
The beauty of Notion’s connected workspace means that unlike a chart created based on static data in a spreadsheet, these dashboards are living records of the work going on across your team, and they update in realtime. Use them for one database, or many. You might want to:
• Centralize scattered tracking systems — if you have teams working across different project trackers (like your engineering tasks, and marketing campaign calendar), consider creating a dashboard to visualize the status of both projects simultaneously.

Chunk 524:
• Get an in-depth view of important work — similarly, you might want to create a dashboard to view different cuts of the same database. Like an OKR dashboard that highlights different project statuses, key result progression, and tasks completed over time.
• Visualize team progress across projects — as a team manager, you could create a dashboard to understand individual performance, irrespective of project statuses. Here, you might look at tasks assigned to each of your reports, overall projects each team member is on, and more.

3 ways to use charts for your team
 So how can you use charts (and dashboards!), to enhance your work? Let’s consider three different kinds of projects that we commonly see managed inside of Notion.
Create an OKR dashboard for your leadership team

Chunk 527:
Charts help visualize OKRs, making it easier to track progress, enhance decision-making, and improve accountability. By analyzing trends and communicating goals clearly, teams can stay agile and keep leadership informed without creating an additional burden of reporting.
 You might consider creating a bar chart of OKR status by team to identify and mitigate potential risks. Similarly, a line chart of key result progress over time can help identify which teams have momentum, and those that might be slowing down.
Visualize what’s coming with your product roadmap

Chunk 528:
Charts offer a strategic view of your product roadmap, enabling your team to allocate resources efficiently and prioritize features with precision. By visualizing upcoming features and their timelines, you can ensure that your team stays on track and meets key milestones, ultimately leading to a more streamlined and effective development process.
Deepen understanding of your content library
 If you manage your content calendar in Notion, you can use charts to understand both in progress and published content at a glance.
 You might use a line chart track content scheduling and publishing to maintain a consistent release schedule. This helps identify delays or inconsistencies in your workflow.

Chunk 529:
At the same time, you can visualize content distribution by tagging pieces based on channel in a bar chart. This ensures that each audience segment receives the appropriate amount of content and could help you refactor plans to make sure all of your audience’s needs are met.
Enhance your existing project management suite with charts
 While this guide covered the bulk of what you need to know to get started, the possibilities for using charts are pretty endless, especially when combined with other project management features in Notion. Here are a few more advanced ways to use charts in your workspace:

Chunk 530:
• Turn synced databases into a chart — Synced databases pull information from tools like Jira, Asana, and Git Hub into your Notion workspace to let you visualize 3rd party tasks as a Notion database. Consider turning these synced databases into charts so that your project manager can get a view of what’s happening across all of these different tools in one glance.

Chunk 531:
• Visualize AI-generated content tags — With AI autofill, you can generate tags for every row in your database based on page content in seconds. Why not use charts to visualize those tags? This makes for quick exploration of large data sets with very little work to audit and tag your data in the first place.

Chunk 532:
• Embed charts from different data sources in your dashboard — You can embed charts from external data sources such as Tableau, Mixpanel, or Google Analytics into Notion. Add these alongside the charts you’re using for project tracking to create a comprehensive view of your team’s performance, without leaving the Notion app.

Whether you need to track project timelines, analyze team performance, or simply make sense of large datasets, charts offer a solution that transforms your database pages into actionable information.

Chunk 538:
• Combine charts to create a dashboard
• 3 ways to use charts for your team
• Visualize what’s coming with your product roadmap
• Enhance your existing project management suite with charts
 With Notion’s connected workspace, you can get your projects to the finish line faster and with less context switching. But without visualizations, managing large amounts of tasks can be cumbersome. Charts take your project management to the next level, helping you to monitor project progress, spot trends, and make decisions.
 With Notion charts you can:

Chunk 539:
• Visualize your project in realtime — Forget about separate tools or tedious copy-pasting. When you add charts from Notion databases, they’ll update automatically whenever a change is made to the underlying data or tasks.
• Make more informed decisions — Looking at hundreds of tasks in a database can be overwhelming. Charts let you easily spot trends, monitor progress, and make decisions to move forward quicker than you might be able to otherwise.
• Break free from complicated analytics tools — We all love our data partners, but we’d prefer not to need them for absolutely everything. With charts, anyone can make beautiful visualizations in a few clicks using the UI they already know (and, hopefully, love!)

Chunk 541:
In this guide, we’ll cover how to make a chart, and discuss ways that you can use them to improve your project management in Notion.
How your database becomes a chart
 Charts work like any other database view — meaning you can view the same data in multiple ways, and switch back and forth between them depending on your needs. To create a view, simply navigate to the + button in your database and select “Chart.” Within your chart view, you can filter your data, and customize your chart to craft a perfect picture of your project’s progress.

 Notion charts come with 4 layout options, each serving a unique purpose:

Chunk 542:
• Donut charts for simple distribution — Donut charts are a simple option for visualizing the distribution of tasks across different categories or team members, providing a clear view of resource allocation. For example, you might use one to analyze and balance the task load across your engineering team in a given sprint.

Chunk 543:
• Horizontal and vertical bar charts for multi-dimensional categorization — Bar charts let you view database items with sub-groups, helping you quickly compare two categories, like status and task type. You might use a one of these to understand OKR progress by team and identify a bottleneck in your operating model.

An AI-powered knowledge hub can save hours for your team every single day. Learn how to build, roll out, and maintain your AI-powered knowledge hub in Notion.
• Set your hub strategy and get stakeholder alignment

Chunk 561:
• Start with a teamspace, fill it with templates
• Selecting use-case specific trackers
• Move, import, and create your content
• Polish and publish
• Share your hub with your team
• Announce your hub, train your team
• Grow & maintain your hub
• Tips & tricks for growing your hub over time
 Employees often struggle to find the information they need, leading to inefficiencies in your work and theirs — and costing your business in big ways.

Chunk 562:
We dreamed up with our customers of a better way to create and find your knowledge, and it's called an AI knowledge hub. These hubs can help you empower employees to find and understand information they need to do their jobs.
 Whether you’re onboarding new employees, creating single source of truth for your engineering documentation, supporting a customer experience team at scale, or looking for a low-lift way to deflect internal IT tickets, a knowledge hub with AI Q&A will help you do it.
 In this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know to build, roll out, and maintain your knowledge hub.
Set your hub strategy and get stakeholder alignment

Chunk 563:
While you might be eager to dive into your knowledge hub build-out (as are we), it’s important to start with a plan. A successful AI implementation includes a clear strategic goal, identifying who will use your knowledge hub, what information they will find, and why you’re investing in building one at all.
 Consider the following tasks before you embark on building your knowledge hub in Notion:
• Identify who will use your hub — Determine the primary users of your knowledge hub. This could include employees, departments, or specific teams that will rely on the hub for information.

Chunk 564:
• Determine key stakeholders — Identify the people who will have a significant influence on the development and success of your knowledge hub. This is likely a group of folks including a Notion champion, a knowledge manager, an IT admin, and other folks that make sense within the context of your org (like bizops, or a chief of staff where relevant).
• Assess current state and gather user feedback — Collect input from potential users to understand their needs and expectations for the knowledge hub. Learn where your audience is finding (or not finding) answers to their questions, and determine how long it’s currently taking them to do so. Your goal throughout this project will be to reduce that time spent searching.

Chunk 565:
• Find your documentation and create a content map for future state — Next, dive into your docs. What questions can be answered with current documentation? Do you need to write new docs? Update old ones? Write this all down, you’ll come back to it later on.
• Set a measurable ROI goal — At this point, we hope you have a sense of the pain points in your current workflows. That means it’s time to set a tangible goal for your upcoming project! Notion AI can help teams save significant time from searching for information and increase their overall productivity and satisfaction at work. Use the Notion AI ROI calculator to set a goal for your team.

Create a space for your hub

Chunk 569:
Your team does its best work when everyone on it has access to the information they need to do their jobs, when they need it. Just like the entrance to your physical office sets the stage for a productive working day, your knowledge hub home-base sets (appropriately) high expectations for what your users will find in Notion.
Start with a teamspace, fill it with templates

Chunk 570:
Begin by setting up a dedicated teamspace for your knowledge hub. This space will serve as the central location where all knowledge hub templates and resources are stored. Make sure it is easily accessible to all team members who will be contributing to or using the hub, either by making it a “default” teamspace (so members are added automatically), or by setting the permissions to open such that anyone can join.
 Once your teamspace is setup, you can begin building the architecture for your hub. For now, focus just on how users will navigate the hub. At a minimum, your knowledge hub template will include the following components.
 Skip this step with templates for every team
 We created best-in-class templates for your knowledge:

Chunk 571:
• Onboarding hub
• Customer support hub
• IT trouble shooting hub, or
• Legal and compliance hub
 Engineering hub
 Onboarding hub
 Customer support hub
 IT trouble shooting hub, or
 Legal and compliance hub
 To use these templates, duplicate them into your workspace, and move each page into the sidebar of your newly created teamspace. Then, read on for guidance on filling your hub with content and rolling it out to your team.

Chunk 572:
• Top level page — you’ll want to utilize a single, top-level page to act as a landing place for your knowledge hub. This is a place for your team to get a birds-eye-view of the information in your hub, and an understanding of how they can use it. It’s also a great place to mention pages that you want to draw attention to, or request feedback (more on that later).

Chunk 573:
• Wiki database (part of your top level page) — once your top-level page is established, you can use the “Turn to Wiki” button in the ... menu on the top left of your Notion page to create a new view for organizing sub-pages. Adding pages into a database will help immensely as you organize and scale your knowledge hub thanks to properties like tags and verification. Learn more about wiki databases here →

• FAQs — the FAQ database serves two important purposes as you build out your knowledge hub. First, it creates a repository for key bits of information that are otherwise buried in long documents. Second, it helps AI more easily find the answers to commonly asked questions, ensuring your team gets what they need as quickly as possible.

Chunk 576:
• AI Q&A — make sure you see the AI icon in the bottom right hand corner of your app (if not, check to make sure you have AI enabled in “settings”). This is where you and your end users will go to ask questions about the content in the knowledge hub.

Selecting use-case specific trackers

Chunk 579:
Knowledge management in a modern workspace goes beyond just the documentation inside your wiki. Your employees need to find answers to more dynamic questions too — like the status of their IT ticket, whether someone else has recently left feedback on a specific product area, and so much more. A knowledge base that doubles as a tracker for your day-to-day work makes this dream a reality.
 Consider the following examples. Each of these leverage Notion’s flexible structure to organize information in a way that is both accessible and actionable, enabling teams to collaborate more effectively.

Fill your hub with content
 Once you’ve set up the architecture of your knowledge hub, you’re ready to start adding your team’s content. This will likely be the longest step in your process, but will pay dividends when it’s time to roll your hub out to your end users. Remember that a knowledge hub is only as valuable as the quality of knowledge housed within it.
Move, import, and create your content

Chunk 581:
Remember how we told you to write down the docs you want to have in your knowledge hub? Time to grab that content map once again (or finish it if you haven’t yet). Once you have a high-level understanding of all the documents and FAQs that you want to add to your hub, you’ll start the heavy lifting. There are three main ways to bring content into your hub:
• Import content from other apps — Bring in existing content from tools like Google Docs, Confluence, Asana, or even PDFs. Centralize your team’s information and make it easily accessible within Notion by placing these pages into your Wiki.

You’re almost ready to share your knowledge hub with the world! Before you do, dot your metaphorical “i”s and cross your metaphorical “t”s by making sure your information is well categorized and organized. Here are a few things we recommend:
• Clean up your page icons — you’d be surprised how far a couple of intentionally picked page icons can go when it comes to rolling out a nicely packaged knowledge hub. When in doubt, pick a color palette and give every page an icon of that color.
• Add a welcoming callout — on your top-level page, add a quick callout explaining what users are looking at, and how they’ll interact with it, and who to contact with questions. This helps to reduce the mental overhead required to engage with a new tool.

Share your hub with your team
 It’s the moment you’ve been waiting for! Rolling out your knowledge hub to your team is a huge accomplishment, but it isn’t the end of the road. In order to ensure your end users get value out of your knowledge hub, you’ll need to invest time into training them on how to use it, and continuously reinforce it’s existence.
Configure permissions for your hub

Chunk 588:
Before you jump into training your team, make sure the right people have the right access to maintain and update your knowledge hub effectively. You’ll manage permissions in the teamspace settings menu, and should deal with users in two primary groups:
• Add teamspace owners — Teamspace owners act as the primary knowledge curators. They are responsible for the overall organization, structure, and maintenance of the knowledge hub. You’ll want to give them Full Access so that they can create, edit, and delete all pages within the teamspace. As teamspace owners, they’ll also be able to adjust teamspace settings, invite/remove members, and manage permissions.

Chunk 589:
• Then, add teamspace Members — Teamspace members contribute to the knowledge base by adding new information, updating existing content, and actively engaging with the AI-powered features. They are also the primary consumers of the knowledge. Give them “Can edit” permissions to edit existing pages and create new pages within the teamspace.

Announce your hub, train your team
 Now that everyone has access to your knowledge hub, it’s time to announce your hub and train your team. You’ll know what announcement channels tend to work best for your company (and we have some tips below, too!), but dont forget to teach your audience how to use your new tool.
 To start, make sure your end users have the resources they need to navigate your knowledge hub. In your announcement comms, focus on helping users learn how to navigate using the sidebar, and how to get answers about work content faster with Q&A.

Chunk 592:
Start emphasizing the value of Notion AI, even demo-ing some questions that users can find the answers to within your new and improved knowledge hub.
 Give your team the resources they need
 Click to expand
Focus on internal communications
 If a resource is created, and no one knows about it, does it even exist? Internal comms are a vital component of your rollout strategy, and you should expect to spend a few weeks (up to a few months) showing off your new hub. Here’s just a few ideas that have helped our customers:

Chunk 593:
• Start with a pilot group — for a bigger roll out, consider starting with a pilot. A diverse pilot group across departments can help test the knowledge hub and gather feedback on usability, content, and AI effectiveness before a larger launch.
• Preview your hub in a team meeting or all hands — schedule a dedicated session to walk through the knowledge hub, highlight key features, and demonstrate how to use it effectively. This ensures everyone is familiar with the new resource.
• Send written communications about your hub — draft an email or internal memo that outlines the purpose of the knowledge hub, provides usage instructions, and includes a link to access it. This helps to reinforce the hub's importance and utility.

Chunk 594:
• Stop answering questions — this is the hardest, and most important component of a successful knowledge hub rollout. In order to build new habits, you’ll want to continuously re-direct your question-asking colleagues to your new and improved knowledge hub. Gently remind them to ask their question to Notion AI before asking in your slack channel or DMs.

Grow & maintain your hub
 Think of your wiki as a garden. Just as a garden needs regular tending to flourish, your knowledge hub requires continuous updates and care. Plant new ideas, prune outdated information, and nurture the content to keep it vibrant and useful for everyone who visits.
Keep your content fresh

Chunk 597:
One of the worst detractors to the long-term health of your knowledge hub is stale or outdated content. That’s why it’s important to set up systems to keep your content fresh.
 We recommend starting with the following:
• Add verified properties — verified properties ensure that the information in your knowledge hub is accurate and trustworthy. Implement a process where subject matter experts review and approve content on a regular cadence. They’ll get notifications when their content is about to expire.
• Create an “admin” view — an admin view allows administrators to oversee and manage the content more efficiently. This view can include filters and sorting options to quickly identify outdated or inaccurate information.

 Employees often struggle to find the information they need, leading to inefficiencies in your work and theirs — and costing your business in big ways.

Chunk 610:
We dreamed up with our customers of a better way to create and find your knowledge, and it's called an AI knowledge hub. These hubs can help you empower employees to find and understand information they need to do their jobs.
 Whether you’re onboarding new employees, creating single source of truth for your engineering documentation, supporting a customer experience team at scale, or looking for a low-lift way to deflect internal IT tickets, a knowledge hub with AI Q&A will help you do it.
 In this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know to build, roll out, and maintain your knowledge hub.
Set your hub strategy and get stakeholder alignment

Chunk 611:
While you might be eager to dive into your knowledge hub build-out (as are we), it’s important to start with a plan. A successful AI implementation includes a clear strategic goal, identifying who will use your knowledge hub, what information they will find, and why you’re investing in building one at all.
 Consider the following tasks before you embark on building your knowledge hub in Notion:
• Identify who will use your hub — Determine the primary users of your knowledge hub. This could include employees, departments, or specific teams that will rely on the hub for information.

Chunk 612:
• Determine key stakeholders — Identify the people who will have a significant influence on the development and success of your knowledge hub. This is likely a group of folks including a Notion champion, a knowledge manager, an IT admin, and other folks that make sense within the context of your org (like bizops, or a chief of staff where relevant).
• Assess current state and gather user feedback — Collect input from potential users to understand their needs and expectations for the knowledge hub. Learn where your audience is finding (or not finding) answers to their questions, and determine how long it’s currently taking them to do so. Your goal throughout this project will be to reduce that time spent searching.

Chunk 613:
• Find your documentation and create a content map for future state — Next, dive into your docs. What questions can be answered with current documentation? Do you need to write new docs? Update old ones? Write this all down, you’ll come back to it later on.
• Set a measurable ROI goal — At this point, we hope you have a sense of the pain points in your current workflows. That means it’s time to set a tangible goal for your upcoming project! Notion AI can help teams save significant time from searching for information and increase their overall productivity and satisfaction at work. Use the Notion AI ROI calculator to set a goal for your team.

Create a space for your hub

Chunk 617:
Your team does its best work when everyone on it has access to the information they need to do their jobs, when they need it. Just like the entrance to your physical office sets the stage for a productive working day, your knowledge hub home-base sets (appropriately) high expectations for what your users will find in Notion.
Start with a teamspace, fill it with templates

Chunk 618:
Begin by setting up a dedicated teamspace for your knowledge hub. This space will serve as the central location where all knowledge hub templates and resources are stored. Make sure it is easily accessible to all team members who will be contributing to or using the hub, either by making it a “default” teamspace (so members are added automatically), or by setting the permissions to open such that anyone can join.
 Once your teamspace is setup, you can begin building the architecture for your hub. For now, focus just on how users will navigate the hub. At a minimum, your knowledge hub template will include the following components.
 Skip this step with templates for every team
 We created best-in-class templates for your knowledge:

Chunk 619:
• Onboarding hub
• Customer support hub
• IT trouble shooting hub, or
• Legal and compliance hub
 Engineering hub

 To use these templates, duplicate them into your workspace, and move each page into the sidebar of your newly created teamspace. Then, read on for guidance on filling your hub with content and rolling it out to your team.

Chunk 620:
• Top level page — you’ll want to utilize a single, top-level page to act as a landing place for your knowledge hub. This is a place for your team to get a birds-eye-view of the information in your hub, and an understanding of how they can use it. It’s also a great place to mention pages that you want to draw attention to, or request feedback (more on that later).

Chunk 621:
• Wiki database (part of your top level page) — once your top-level page is established, you can use the “Turn to Wiki” button in the ... menu on the top left of your Notion page to create a new view for organizing sub-pages. Adding pages into a database will help immensely as you organize and scale your knowledge hub thanks to properties like tags and verification. Learn more about wiki databases here →

• FAQs — the FAQ database serves two important purposes as you build out your knowledge hub. First, it creates a repository for key bits of information that are otherwise buried in long documents. Second, it helps AI more easily find the answers to commonly asked questions, ensuring your team gets what they need as quickly as possible.

Chunk 624:
• AI Q&A — make sure you see the AI icon in the bottom right hand corner of your app (if not, check to make sure you have AI enabled in “settings”). This is where you and your end users will go to ask questions about the content in the knowledge hub.

• Use-case specific trackers — These are tailored to meet the specific needs of different teams within your organization — like a product feedback tracker, or IT request system. They help in gaining insight into workflows, tracking progress, and ensuring that everyone has access to the necessary information.

Selecting use-case specific trackers

Chunk 627:
Knowledge management in a modern workspace goes beyond just the documentation inside your wiki. Your employees need to find answers to more dynamic questions too — like the status of their IT ticket, whether someone else has recently left feedback on a specific product area, and so much more. A knowledge base that doubles as a tracker for your day-to-day work makes this dream a reality.
 Consider the following examples. Each of these leverage Notion’s flexible structure to organize information in a way that is both accessible and actionable, enabling teams to collaborate more effectively.

Fill your hub with content
 Once you’ve set up the architecture of your knowledge hub, you’re ready to start adding your team’s content. This will likely be the longest step in your process, but will pay dividends when it’s time to roll your hub out to your end users. Remember that a knowledge hub is only as valuable as the quality of knowledge housed within it.
Move, import, and create your content

Chunk 629:
Remember how we told you to write down the docs you want to have in your knowledge hub? Time to grab that content map once again (or finish it if you haven’t yet). Once you have a high-level understanding of all the documents and FAQs that you want to add to your hub, you’ll start the heavy lifting. There are three main ways to bring content into your hub:
• Import content from other apps — Bring in existing content from tools like Google Docs, Confluence, Asana, or even PDFs. Centralize your team’s information and make it easily accessible within Notion by placing these pages into your Wiki.

 If a resource is created, and no one knows about it, does it even exist? Internal comms are a vital component of your rollout strategy, and you should expect to spend a few weeks (up to a few months) showing off your new hub. Here’s just a few ideas that have helped our customers:

Chunk 641:
• Start with a pilot group — for a bigger roll out, consider starting with a pilot. A diverse pilot group across departments can help test the knowledge hub and gather feedback on usability, content, and AI effectiveness before a larger launch.
• Preview your hub in a team meeting or all hands — schedule a dedicated session to walk through the knowledge hub, highlight key features, and demonstrate how to use it effectively. This ensures everyone is familiar with the new resource.
• Send written communications about your hub — draft an email or internal memo that outlines the purpose of the knowledge hub, provides usage instructions, and includes a link to access it. This helps to reinforce the hub's importance and utility.

Chunk 642:
• Stop answering questions — this is the hardest, and most important component of a successful knowledge hub rollout. In order to build new habits, you’ll want to continuously re-direct your question-asking colleagues to your new and improved knowledge hub. Gently remind them to ask their question to Notion AI before asking in your slack channel or DMs.

Grow & maintain your hub
 Think of your wiki as a garden. Just as a garden needs regular tending to flourish, your knowledge hub requires continuous updates and care. Plant new ideas, prune outdated information, and nurture the content to keep it vibrant and useful for everyone who visits.
Keep your content fresh

Chunk 645:
One of the worst detractors to the long-term health of your knowledge hub is stale or outdated content. That’s why it’s important to set up systems to keep your content fresh.
 We recommend starting with the following:
• Add verified properties — verified properties ensure that the information in your knowledge hub is accurate and trustworthy. Implement a process where subject matter experts review and approve content on a regular cadence. They’ll get notifications when their content is about to expire.
• Create an “admin” view — an admin view allows administrators to oversee and manage the content more efficiently. This view can include filters and sorting options to quickly identify outdated or inaccurate information.

 Employees often struggle to find the information they need, leading to inefficiencies in your work and theirs — and costing your business in big ways.

Chunk 658:
We dreamed up with our customers of a better way to create and find your knowledge, and it's called an AI knowledge hub. These hubs can help you empower employees to find and understand information they need to do their jobs.
 Whether you’re onboarding new employees, creating single source of truth for your engineering documentation, supporting a customer experience team at scale, or looking for a low-lift way to deflect internal IT tickets, a knowledge hub with AI Q&A will help you do it.
 In this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know to build, roll out, and maintain your knowledge hub.
Set your hub strategy and get stakeholder alignment

Chunk 659:
While you might be eager to dive into your knowledge hub build-out (as are we), it’s important to start with a plan. A successful AI implementation includes a clear strategic goal, identifying who will use your knowledge hub, what information they will find, and why you’re investing in building one at all.
 Consider the following tasks before you embark on building your knowledge hub in Notion:
• Identify who will use your hub — Determine the primary users of your knowledge hub. This could include employees, departments, or specific teams that will rely on the hub for information.

Chunk 660:
• Determine key stakeholders — Identify the people who will have a significant influence on the development and success of your knowledge hub. This is likely a group of folks including a Notion champion, a knowledge manager, an IT admin, and other folks that make sense within the context of your org (like bizops, or a chief of staff where relevant).
• Assess current state and gather user feedback — Collect input from potential users to understand their needs and expectations for the knowledge hub. Learn where your audience is finding (or not finding) answers to their questions, and determine how long it’s currently taking them to do so. Your goal throughout this project will be to reduce that time spent searching.

Chunk 661:
• Find your documentation and create a content map for future state — Next, dive into your docs. What questions can be answered with current documentation? Do you need to write new docs? Update old ones? Write this all down, you’ll come back to it later on.
• Set a measurable ROI goal — At this point, we hope you have a sense of the pain points in your current workflows. That means it’s time to set a tangible goal for your upcoming project! Notion AI can help teams save significant time from searching for information and increase their overall productivity and satisfaction at work. Use the Notion AI ROI calculator to set a goal for your team.

Create a space for your hub

Chunk 665:
Your team does its best work when everyone on it has access to the information they need to do their jobs, when they need it. Just like the entrance to your physical office sets the stage for a productive working day, your knowledge hub home-base sets (appropriately) high expectations for what your users will find in Notion.
Start with a teamspace, fill it with templates

Chunk 666:
Begin by setting up a dedicated teamspace for your knowledge hub. This space will serve as the central location where all knowledge hub templates and resources are stored. Make sure it is easily accessible to all team members who will be contributing to or using the hub, either by making it a “default” teamspace (so members are added automatically), or by setting the permissions to open such that anyone can join.
 Once your teamspace is setup, you can begin building the architecture for your hub. For now, focus just on how users will navigate the hub. At a minimum, your knowledge hub template will include the following components.
 Skip this step with templates for every team
 We created best-in-class templates for your knowledge:

Chunk 667:
• Onboarding hub
• Customer support hub
• IT trouble shooting hub, or
• Legal and compliance hub
 Engineering hub
 Onboarding hub
 Customer support hub
 IT trouble shooting hub, or
 Legal and compliance hub
 To use these templates, duplicate them into your workspace, and move each page into the sidebar of your newly created teamspace. Then, read on for guidance on filling your hub with content and rolling it out to your team.

Chunk 668:
• Top level page — you’ll want to utilize a single, top-level page to act as a landing place for your knowledge hub. This is a place for your team to get a birds-eye-view of the information in your hub, and an understanding of how they can use it. It’s also a great place to mention pages that you want to draw attention to, or request feedback (more on that later).

Chunk 669:
• Wiki database (part of your top level page) — once your top-level page is established, you can use the “Turn to Wiki” button in the ... menu on the top left of your Notion page to create a new view for organizing sub-pages. Adding pages into a database will help immensely as you organize and scale your knowledge hub thanks to properties like tags and verification. Learn more about wiki databases here →

• FAQs — the FAQ database serves two important purposes as you build out your knowledge hub. First, it creates a repository for key bits of information that are otherwise buried in long documents. Second, it helps AI more easily find the answers to commonly asked questions, ensuring your team gets what they need as quickly as possible.

Chunk 672:
• AI Q&A — make sure you see the AI icon in the bottom right hand corner of your app (if not, check to make sure you have AI enabled in “settings”). This is where you and your end users will go to ask questions about the content in the knowledge hub.

• Use-case specific trackers — These are tailored to meet the specific needs of different teams within your organization — like a product feedback tracker, or IT request system. They help in gaining insight into workflows, tracking progress, and ensuring that everyone has access to the necessary information.

Selecting use-case specific trackers

Chunk 675:
Knowledge management in a modern workspace goes beyond just the documentation inside your wiki. Your employees need to find answers to more dynamic questions too — like the status of their IT ticket, whether someone else has recently left feedback on a specific product area, and so much more. A knowledge base that doubles as a tracker for your day-to-day work makes this dream a reality.
 Consider the following examples. Each of these leverage Notion’s flexible structure to organize information in a way that is both accessible and actionable, enabling teams to collaborate more effectively.

Fill your hub with content
 Once you’ve set up the architecture of your knowledge hub, you’re ready to start adding your team’s content. This will likely be the longest step in your process, but will pay dividends when it’s time to roll your hub out to your end users. Remember that a knowledge hub is only as valuable as the quality of knowledge housed within it.
Move, import, and create your content

Chunk 677:
Remember how we told you to write down the docs you want to have in your knowledge hub? Time to grab that content map once again (or finish it if you haven’t yet). Once you have a high-level understanding of all the documents and FAQs that you want to add to your hub, you’ll start the heavy lifting. There are three main ways to bring content into your hub:
• Import content from other apps — Bring in existing content from tools like Google Docs, Confluence, Asana, or even PDFs. Centralize your team’s information and make it easily accessible within Notion by placing these pages into your Wiki.

• Use Move to to gather content from your Notion workspace — Consolidate all relevant Notion pages into your knowledge hub by using the Move to function and moving them into your new wiki database. This helps to keep your workspace organized and ensure that all necessary information is in one place.

Chunk 679:
• Create new content, and use AI to help — AI can help you start from scratch to create a draft in seconds so all you have to do is add the extra information your team needs. Like uploaded files, video recordings, or even slide decks. Plus, If you’re working through half-baked docs, or translating very technical language, try using Notion AI to expand and organize your thoughts into comprehensive, well-structured content.

Polish and publish

Chunk 681:
You’re almost ready to share your knowledge hub with the world! Before you do, dot your metaphorical “i”s and cross your metaphorical “t”s by making sure your information is well categorized and organized. Here are a few things we recommend:
• Clean up your page icons — you’d be surprised how far a couple of intentionally picked page icons can go when it comes to rolling out a nicely packaged knowledge hub. When in doubt, pick a color palette and give every page an icon of that color.
• Add a welcoming callout — on your top-level page, add a quick callout explaining what users are looking at, and how they’ll interact with it, and who to contact with questions. This helps to reduce the mental overhead required to engage with a new tool.

Share your hub with your team
 It’s the moment you’ve been waiting for! Rolling out your knowledge hub to your team is a huge accomplishment, but it isn’t the end of the road. In order to ensure your end users get value out of your knowledge hub, you’ll need to invest time into training them on how to use it, and continuously reinforce it’s existence.
Configure permissions for your hub

Chunk 684:
Before you jump into training your team, make sure the right people have the right access to maintain and update your knowledge hub effectively. You’ll manage permissions in the teamspace settings menu, and should deal with users in two primary groups:
• Add teamspace owners — Teamspace owners act as the primary knowledge curators. They are responsible for the overall organization, structure, and maintenance of the knowledge hub. You’ll want to give them Full Access so that they can create, edit, and delete all pages within the teamspace. As teamspace owners, they’ll also be able to adjust teamspace settings, invite/remove members, and manage permissions.

Chunk 685:
• Then, add teamspace Members — Teamspace members contribute to the knowledge base by adding new information, updating existing content, and actively engaging with the AI-powered features. They are also the primary consumers of the knowledge. Give them “Can edit” permissions to edit existing pages and create new pages within the teamspace.

Announce your hub, train your team
 Now that everyone has access to your knowledge hub, it’s time to announce your hub and train your team. You’ll know what announcement channels tend to work best for your company (and we have some tips below, too!), but dont forget to teach your audience how to use your new tool.
 To start, make sure your end users have the resources they need to navigate your knowledge hub. In your announcement comms, focus on helping users learn how to navigate using the sidebar, and how to get answers about work content faster with Q&A.

Chunk 688:
Start emphasizing the value of Notion AI, even demo-ing some questions that users can find the answers to within your new and improved knowledge hub.

 How does artificial intelligence work?
 The computer finds patterns in a large set of data called training data to make a model.
 The computer tests the model by asking a question it already knows the answer to and analyzing how accurate its answer is, using test data.
 With more inputs and training data, it learns and improves the model over time.

Chunk 770:
Read more about how artificial intelligence works, as well as its current limitations, here.

 Databases are a powerful Notion feature that can unlock your toolmaking potential. Create databases, learn about layout types, and build databases for teams.
Intro to databases

Chunk 948:
Databases in Notion are collections of pages. Here, we'll introduce you to the general structure of a database, discuss the different menus and options, and deep dive into how to open and edit pages within a database. 🗃
Using database views
 Here, we'll introduce you to the different customization options and layouts that exist once you have a database set up in your workspace.
Timeline view
 Timeline is a type of Notion database that’s way more than a Gantt chart. It gives you complete flexibility to scope projects, adjust their timelines, and customize your workflow.
Table view

Chunk 949:
Tables are Notion's most traditional database view, but our tables are a lot more powerful than a grid with some rows and columns! Open each row as its own Notion page, or visualize in other database views.
Gallery view
 Galleries are Notion's most visual database view. Use them to showcase beautiful photos for mood boards, team directories, vacation photos and more.
List view
 Lists are Notion's most minimalist database view. All the power of a database, but without the visual clutter. Use them for meeting notes, journal entries, process documentation and more!
Board view

Chunk 950:
One of Notion's most powerful features, Boards are the best way to manage projects & tasks. Use them to group your databases by select, multiselect, and person properties.
Calendar view
 Calendars are a great way to visualize dates from any database in Notion. Use them for your company's social media planning, or add a calendar view to your product management databases.
Using database templates
 Instead of manually typing out the same structure and content for every new page, you can use database templates to automate your processes and save some time.
Using linked databases

Chunk 951:
Linked databases let you include synced copies of the same content across different pages. Use them to include a filtered view of team tasks in your meeting notes, or create a dashboard of tasks assigned to you from different databases.
Using advanced database filters
 Managing tasks and projects in Notion just got a big upgrade. With new advanced database filters, you have even more control and customizability over your database views - make them as specific as you want for a more organized and efficient workflow.
Relation and rollup properties
 Notion databases become even more powerful when you link them together. Link to a row from another database with a relation, or show a specific property from a related table with a rollup.

Chunk 952:
Notion for people ops
 Explain how Notion can keep teams on the same page and be able to set up Notion for large teams using teamspaces.

Welcome to the connected workspace where better, faster work happens. Let’s cover all the things you need to know to begin exploring Notion.
Start here

Chunk 1098:
Curious about what Notion is? We'll show you right here, and in the articles to come. Let's go! 📍
What is a block?
 Think of Notion as a bottomless bin of building blocks. Build whatever you want, however you want! Every page you create in Notion will be composed of many "blocks," in the same way a LEGO castle is composed of many LEGO bricks 🧱
Create a page
 Every page you create in Notion is a fresh canvas where you can add whatever content you want. Follow these steps to create your first one 📄
Create a subpage
 There are no folders in Notion. Instead, you can organize pages inside pages... inside pages. Here, we'll show you how to create a page within another page, which we call a subpage 📑
What is a database?

Chunk 1099:
Databases are a core feature in Notion that help you manage and organize your pages. Let's explain what they are and how they can help you level up your workspace 🗄
Create a database
 Now we'll create a database and use it to show off essential database actions and features. You'll get to play with database properties, views, filters, and sorts - let's get into it 📈
Start with a template
 To help you take on a variety of challenges with Notion, we've created lots of templates that you can adopt and customize as your own — including 5 "starter templates" already in your workspace! Here's how to use them 💾
Share your work

Chunk 1100:
Share any Notion page you create with select people, your whole team, or the entire web. It's up to you. Here's a quick overview of how to share 🗣

Curious about what Notion is? We'll show you right here, and in the articles to come. Let's go! 📍
 We like to describe Notion as a set of building blocks for creating things you love to use on your computer, such as:
• Documents

Chunk 1104:
• Public websites
• Knowledge bases
• The world's most beautiful notes... 😉

Think of Notion as a bottomless bin of building blocks. Build whatever you want, however you want! Every page you create in Notion will be composed of many "blocks," in the same way a LEGO castle is composed of many LEGO bricks 🧱

Chunk 1108:
• Everything in Notion is a "block"
• Blocks can be rearranged
Everything in Notion is a "block"
 When you create your first page in Notion and begin typing, you've started with a text block. But Notion pages can contain a lot more than plain text!
 Imagine every piece of content you add to a page — whether it's text, an image, or a table — as a single building block. Every page is a stack of blocks combined however you want.
 Here's just one example page with different block types pointed out:
 Tip: Hit the / key on your keyboard (or tap the + button above your keyboard if you're on mobile) to see all the different types of content you can add.
Blocks can transform

Chunk 1109:
Any block in Notion can be turned into any other type of block in order to use, view, or deepen that information in a new way.
 Try this out by clicking the ⋮⋮ symbol and choosing Turn into to convert your block to something else!
Blocks can be rearranged
 The ⋮⋮ button can be used to drag and drop existing blocks. This makes it simple to rearrange, reorder, and reshape your thoughts with one motion.

• Create a subpage

Chunk 1119:
• Rearrange your page structure
Create a subpage
 A subpage is a page inside a page. You can create any number of subpages for a page.
 There are multiple ways to create a subpage:
• Open a page (this will be the subpage’s parent page) and use the slash command /page.
• Find your desired parent page in your sidebar and select + next to it. This will create a subpage in that page. When you return to the parent page, you’ll see the subpage there.

Navigate with your sidebar and breadcrumbs
 When you open the toggle for the parent page in your sidebar, you’ll see its subpages there.

Chunk 1121:
Additionally, at the top of your page, you’ll see breadcrumbs that show you what page you’re in, and where that page lives.
Rearrange your page structure
 The pages in your workspace can be easily rearranged.
• To take a subpage out of its parent page, click on it in the sidebar and drag it out of the parent page's toggle.
• To make a page a subpage, click on it in the sidebar and drag it into another page.

Databases are a core feature in Notion that help you manage and organize your pages. Let's explain what they are and how they can help you level up your workspace 🗄
• Databases are pages themselves

Chunk 1125:
• Database views display the same content in different ways
Databases are collections of pages
 Think of Notion databases as filing cabinets or notebooks. Each database serves as a container, letting you easily organize multiple Notion pages in a single structure. In the screenshot below, every row of the table is a page within the database "Docs."
 This gives you a birds' eye view of an entire collection of pages at once. When you need to dive deeper, each page in a database can be opened, revealing its detailed contents.
Databases are pages themselves

Chunk 1126:
But wait - each database is also a page itself! This is powerful, because it allows you to move and nest databases alongside other content, just like any other page.
Databases have properties
 To help you organize all of the pages within a database, properties can be added to contextualize, label, and augment each individual item.
 You can then search, filter, and sort by these property values.
Database views display the same content in different ways
 Databases in Notion are not static. The set of pages within each database can be displayed in many different forms, or what we call views.

Chunk 1127:
In addition to table view, the contents of a database can be visualized as a list, board, calendar, gallery, or timeline - whatever makes the information the most useful.

Now we'll create a database and use it to show off essential database actions and features. You'll get to play with database properties, views, filters, and sorts - let's get into it 📈
• Add data to your table

Chunk 1130:
• Create new database views
• Filter and sort your data
Create a new table
 Add a new page and under Get started with and select Table.
 The first column is where you enter the name of your database pages. Each column in a Notion table corresponds to a property that gives your item context.
 Click a property heading, then Edit property and Type to see all of your property choices.
Add data to your table
 For this example, we'll create a task database.
 Add some tasks you're working on in the Name column.
 Now add some values to the Tags column using the multi-select property. The options could be something like P1, P2, and P3 to indicate the priority of a task.

Chunk 1131:
Add a new property using the + button to the right of the Tags heading.
 Change its name to Due Date. Click the property heading, then Edit property and Type and select Date. Now when you click on a cell under Due Date, you'll see the date picker.
Open a row as a page
 Every item in a Notion database is also a whole page of its own! You can add any content you want inside, including other databases.
 To open a row as a page, hover over a cell in the Name column and click OPEN.
 You can add or edit any properties.
• You can also add additional content into the body of the page.
 You can also add additional content into the body of the page.
Create new database views

Chunk 1132:
You can create different views of the same data. Put it into a board, a calendar, a list, a gallery, or a timeline — depending on your needs. Let's try one.
 Click + at the top of your table. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and select Add view.
 Give your new view a name and choose Board from the right-side menu.
 This displays rows from your table into cards on a board, grouped by tag. Clicking on a card still opens it as a page. It's all the same content, just visualized in a different way!
 Learn more about views here →
 Tip: Different views are good for different things, and you can have as many as you need!
• Gallery view is great if you're storing images in your database.

Chunk 1133:
• Lists are helpful for minimalist storage of documentation.
• Calendar view displays your pages by an assigned date property.
• Timelines are useful for visualizing project dates and length.
 Gallery view is great if you're storing images in your database.
 Lists are helpful for minimalist storage of documentation.
 Calendar view displays your pages by an assigned date property.
 Timelines are useful for visualizing project dates and length.
Filter and sort your data
 Filter by property to focus on specific parts of your database.
 Click the filter icon at the top of your table, then select one of the default options or + Add advanced filter.

Chunk 1134:
Then select the criteria that needs to be met. The middle dropdown will give you different options depending on the property.
 In this case, let's choose Tags as the property, and say it must contain P1.
 Add sorts to reorder your database depending on property values. Sorts are helpful for quickly ordering your data by priority, date, tags, etc.
• Click ⇅ at the top of your table, then select the property you'd like to sort by.For example, choose Due Date and then Ascending. This reorders tasks from closest to furthest due date.
• For example, choose Due Date and then Ascending. This reorders tasks from closest to furthest due date.
 Click ⇅ at the top of your table, then select the property you'd like to sort by.

Chunk 1135:
• For example, choose Due Date and then Ascending. This reorders tasks from closest to furthest due date.
 For example, choose Due Date and then Ascending. This reorders tasks from closest to furthest due date.
 You'll see your database change in real time based on your filter and sort criteria. You can add as many filters and sorts as you want, and each view has its own filter and sorts.

• Duplicate community-made templates
Starter templates
 When you first sign up for Notion, you'll see a collection of 5 templates in your sidebar. These have been selected for you based on what you told us during onboarding. You can choose to add them to your workspace so you can edit them however you want, or remove them.

 Instructions are included inside each template in two ways:

Chunk 1140:
• For databases, they are at the top and can be hidden by hovering over the top of the page and clicking Hide description.
• For pages, instructions are scattered throughout in callout boxes that you can delete just like you'd delete any other content block.

 In addition to in-app templates, you can duplicate a public page into your own workspace as template. Learn more about public pages here →

Chunk 1141:
The Notion Template Gallery includes thousands of templates built for many purposes by Notion users around the world, which you can use as a starting point (or inspiration ✨)! Once you've duplicated a public template page into your own workspace, tweak it to match your workflow perfectly.
 Browse our Template Gallery: notion.so/templates →
FAQs
 Can I make my page a template to use elsewhere in my workspace?

Share any Notion page you create with select people, your whole team, or the entire web. It's up to you. Here's a quick overview of how to share 🗣
• Share with your team
• Share with the web

Chunk 1147:
Share with one person
 You can invite people inside or outside your workspace to share a Notion page with you.
 Start with your page in Private in your sidebar.
 On the page, go to Share at the top right.
 Enter the person's name or email address in the space provided, choose a level of access, and click Invite.
• If the person is outside your workspace, they'll join the page as a guest.
• If the person is already a member of your workspace, you'll see their profile photo pop up in the invite menu, and the page will show up under Shared in your sidebar, as seen above.
 If the person is outside your workspace, they'll join the page as a guest.

Chunk 1148:
If the person is already a member of your workspace, you'll see their profile photo pop up in the invite menu, and the page will show up under Shared in your sidebar, as seen above.
Share with your team
 If you have multiple people working with you in Notion, you can quickly share any page with all of them. There are several ways to do this:
• Share with everyone in your workspace. Click Share at the top right of the page, and grant access to Everyone at [workspace name]. You can also assign everyone in your workspace a particular access level from the dropdown. For example, everyone Can view instead of being able to edit.

Chunk 1149:
• Create a page in any default teamspace in your sidebar. Everyone in your workspace is a member of default teamspaces and will automatically have access to pages in them. Learn more about teamspaces →
• Drag a private page to a default teamspace in your sidebar. This automatically shares it with everyone.

Your Notion workspace is the home for all your content. You can work in your workspace alone or share your workspace with collaborators — it's up to you! Here, we'll teach you how to create, join, and use workspaces.

Chunk 1162:
Intro to workspaces
 Everything you do in Notion takes place in a workspace. It's your virtual home to organize information and create exactly the way you want — as just one person, together as a team, or across a whole company. Expand, edit, and mold it to fit your needs 🏠
Navigate with the sidebar
 Notion's left-hand sidebar makes it easy to structure all the content in your workspace. Here's everything you need to know on how to organize, rearrange, and find your pages within the sidebar 🧭
Create & manage workspaces

Chunk 1163:
When you're brand new to Notion, it's best to keep it simple and start with just one workspace. But as you start using Notion for more things, and with more groups of people, you can keep different kinds of content separate by using multiple workspaces 🏘
Create & navigate teamspaces
 Teamspaces help keep your content organized into specific areas. Keep your sidebar tidy by joining just the ones you need to access! Here's how 📚
Search in your workspace
 Notion is designed for you to add as many layers of information as you and your team need to solve any problem. Search ensures that Notion is an easily navigable archive of information 🔍
Home & My tasks

Chunk 1164:
Home gives you a view of all of the docs, tasks, and events that need your attention 🏡
Workspaces on mobile
 We've built Notion on mobile to replicate as much desktop functionality as possible. That said, there are a number of interactions that work differently by default. This is a quick tour of how Notion workspaces look and operate on your phone or tablet 📱

Editor
• This is where all the content you create lives.

• Control menus are at the top (we'll go through those in more detail), but otherwise, Notion's editor is a blank canvas for you to write, plan, brainstorm, and more.
• You'll notice that as soon as you start typing in this space, those top menus fade into the background, leaving you with your thoughts in a spacious zone of focus.

Team vs. personal workspaces
 A workspace operates slightly differently if you're using it with a team than if you're using it on your own:
• In personal workspaces, newly created pages will be private by default unless they're explicitly shared.

Chunk 1188:
• Sidebar organization under the Teamspace section is also viewable by all members. The page arrangement will look the same to everyone, although individuals can toggle different pages open or closed without affecting everyone's view.
• On Notion's Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan, there are members and admins with different levels of permission. Learn more about sharing and permissions here →

FAQs
 Can I switch between workspaces that are associated with different email addresses?
 To add your workspaces from another email account, use the Add another account button in the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and follow the steps to login to your other account. More on this here →
 I clicked the Create or Join Workspace button, but it will only let me create a workspace. How do I join a workspace?

Chunk 1190:
You can only join a workspace via the Create or Join Workspace button if that workspace has the Allowed Email Domains setting enabled, which lets users with your email domain join the workspace automatically.
 To join a workspace, you'll need to ask an admin from that workspace to send you an invite.
 To add your workspaces from another email account, use the Add another account button in the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and follow the steps to login to your other account. More on this here →
 My sidebar doesn't have any sections. How do I turn those on?

Chunk 1191:
The sidebar sections reflect the sharing settings of your account. If you have more than one person in your workspace, a Teamspaces section appears in the sidebar for your collaborative work with that person, and the Private section is there for your personal pages that are only visible to you.
 When I subscribe to a Plus Plan, does it cover all my workspaces?
 Paid plans only apply to one workspace, and don't cover the whole account. Workspaces are completely separate, so you won't be able to link any content between them.
 We recommend using the least number of workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.
 How can I migrate all my Notion content to a different workspace?

Chunk 1192:
Note: Any migrated content will be duplicated to the new workspace and these pages sometimes have issues. For more information, click here.
 To move your content from one workspace to another associated with the same account, click
•

Teamspace pages
 If you're on a Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan, you'll see a sidebar section called Teamspaces. Teamspaces can be used by and tailored for every team within your organization or company. Learn more about teamspaces →
 Every workspace has at least one default teamspace, which all members will see in their sidebar. Any of the pages in default teamspaces in your sidebar can be seen and shared by the other members of the workspace.
 In the Teamspaces section, you'll also see any other teamspaces that you are a member of. Click the name of any teamspace to reveal or hide its nested pages.

Chunk 1208:

 Favorites is where you can easily access all of the pages most important to you. This section will appear in your sidebar once you favorite your first page.
 To add a page to your favorites, navigate to it, then click ⭐ at the top of it. You'll see it appear under Favorites in your sidebar.
 To remove a page from your favorites, open it and unclick ⭐ at the top. You can also hover over the page in your sidebar and click
•
•
• . You'll see the option to Remove from Favorites.
Nested pages

Chunk 1209:
You can open up each toggle in your sidebar to reveal pages nested inside other pages. All pages have the same functionality, even if they're nested as sub-pages.
 For database pages, you can open the toggle to see all the different views you've created of that database. These are represented with a
• next to them.
Settings, templates, and trash
 At the bottom of the sidebar, there are a couple more workspace essentials.
• Settings: Adjust Notion to your preference. Learn more about settings here →

Chunk 1210:
• Trash: The Trash contains all the pages you delete. You can drag and drop them in here. You can also click on trash to search, view and restore these pages. Note that you won’t be able to edit a page that’s in the trash unless you restore it.

FAQs
 How do I log out of my Notion account?

Chunk 1219:
Click on your current workspace's name at the very top left of your sidebar. Scroll to the bottom, and you'll see the option to Log out next to your email address.
 My sidebar doesn't have any sections. How do I turn those on?
 The sidebar sections reflect the sharing settings of your account. If you have more than one person in your workspace, a Teamspaces section appears in the sidebar for your collaborative work with that person, and the Private section is there for your personal pages that are only visible to you.
 Can I rename the sidebar sections or add my own custom sections?
 Not at the moment, unfortunately 😓 If your sidebar is feeling cluttered, you can always consolidate some of your pages under more top-level pages.

• Join an existing workspace
• Switch between workspaces
• Delete a workspace
• Add another email account
• Log out of an account
Create a new workspace
 By default, your workspace switcher will display all the workspaces associated with your email address. To create another workspace:
 Open the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window.

Chunk 1224:
Choose which email account you'd like the new workspace to be associated with, and click the
•
•
• to the right of that email address.
 Click Join or create workspace.
 If you're using your work email, you may see a list of workspaces that you can auto-join. We'll cover that just below!
 If you want to create a brand new workspace, scroll past the list of existing workspaces and click Create workspace.
 Follow the steps to set up your new workspace and you're on your way!
 Tip: Multiple workspaces come in handy to separate different kinds of work. For example, you could have one workspace for personal stuff, one for school notes, and one for keeping track of freelance projects.
Join an existing workspace

Chunk 1225:
There are a couple ways to join a workspace someone else has made:
• An admin from that workspace adds you as a member, and you receive an email with a link to join. You'll be prompted to sign in with your email, and you'll be placed into the workspace as a paid member.
• If your email domain (e.g. name@domain.com) has auto-join enabled, you can use the Join or create workspace button in the workspace switcher, and you'll see a list of workspaces you can join.
 An admin from that workspace adds you as a member, and you receive an email with a link to join. You'll be prompted to sign in with your email, and you'll be placed into the workspace as a paid member.

Chunk 1226:
If your email domain (e.g. name@domain.com) has auto-join enabled, you can use the Join or create workspace button in the workspace switcher, and you'll see a list of workspaces you can join.
 Note: If you're using Notion with a personal email address such as gmail.com or outlook.com, or a school email address such as nyu.edu, you won't be able to auto-join other workspaces.
 To join a workspace from another email account, use the Add another account button in the workspace switcher.
Switch between workspaces
 Throughout the day, you might need to hop between different workspaces to get things done. Just click on the name of your current workspace and select the one you want to jump to from the dropdown menu. That's it!

Chunk 1227:
You can also access Settings from the workspace switcher.
 Tip: On desktop, you can use the shortcut ctrl + shift + # to switch workspaces, in which # corresponds to the placement of each workspace in the dropdown workspace switcher menu.
 You'll see the shortcuts in the menu, next to each workspace name!
Leave a workspace
 Once you leave a workspace:
• You’ll lose access to all of the content inside it. You might want to export any data that you want to keep after you leave the workspace.
• It’ll be removed from your workspace switcher.
• You can ask an admin to re-add you to the workspace if you want to access it again.

Chunk 1228:

 You can ask an admin to re-add you to the workspace if you want to access it again.
 To leave a workspace:
 Go to Settings in your sidebar.
 Select Settings.
 Scroll down to Danger zone and select Leave workspace.
Delete a workspace
 Once a workspace is deleted:
• This action is permanent.
• All of the content inside of it will be deleted. You won’t be able to access your content — even your private pages. You might want to export any data that you want to keep after you delete the workspace.

Chunk 1229:
• The deleted workspace will be deleted for everyone in it. This means all users who were part of a workspace before it was deleted will no longer have access to that workspace or any content inside that workspace.
• You'll be returned to another workspace you belong to, or the sign up page for Notion if you don't belong to any others.
 This action is permanent.
 All of the content inside of it will be deleted. You won’t be able to access your content — even your private pages. You might want to export any data that you want to keep after you delete the workspace.

Chunk 1230:

 You'll be returned to another workspace you belong to, or the sign up page for Notion if you don't belong to any others.
 To delete a workspace:
 Go to Settings in your sidebar.
 Select Settings.
 Scroll down to Danger zone and select Delete entire workspace. You'll be asked to type the name of your workspace to confirm you want to proceed.
Add another email account

Chunk 1231:
By default, your workspace switcher will display all the workspaces associated with your email address. But you may prefer to use your personal email with your personal workspaces, and your work email with your team workspaces.
 To enable you to view all of your workspaces at once, we support logging in with multiple accounts at the same time!
 To add workspaces from another Notion account, open the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and click Add another account.
 Follow the steps to login to your other account, and you'll be taken straight to that workspace. You can also create a new account at this step.

Chunk 1232:
The next time you open the workspace switcher, you'll see the new account and all of its workspaces added to the dropdown.
 Tip: By adding more accounts to your workspace switcher, there's no need to log out of one account in order to log into another! This lets you keep work and life separate, while making sure that you can access any of your content across any account, on any device, completely seamlessly.
Log out of an account
 You can log out of individual accounts, or log out of all your accounts at once.
 Open the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window.
 To log out of one account but stay logged into others, use the
•
•
• button to the right of the account you want to log out of. Then, click Log out.

Chunk 1233:
To log out of all your accounts at once, use the Log out all button at the bottom of the workspace switcher.
 Note: Login tokens expire after 90 days. When you're logged out of your accounts due to token expiration, you will need to re-add any additional accounts by using the Add another account button in the workspace switcher.
FAQs
 How can I migrate all my Notion content to a different workspace?
 Note: Any migrated content will be duplicated to the new workspace and these pages sometimes have issues. For more information, click here.

Chunk 1234:
To move your content from one workspace to another associated with the same account, click
•
•
• next to each of the top-level pages in your sidebar (or right click) and select Move to. At the bottom of the move menu, you’ll see a drop down to select a different workspace.
 When you move top-level pages, all their sub-pages go with them. They'll appear in the Private section but can be moved wherever you want to put them.
 I clicked the Join or create workspace button, but it will only let me create a workspace. How do I join a workspace?
 You can only join a workspace via the Join or create workspace button if that workspace has the Allowed Email Domains setting enabled to allow users with your email domain join the workspace automatically.

Chunk 1235:
Otherwise, you'll need to ask an admin from the workspace to send you an invite.
 When I subscribe to a paid plan, does it cover all of my workspaces?
 Paid plans only apply to one workspace and don't cover the whole account. Workspaces are completely separate silos, so you won't be able to link any content between them.
 We recommend using the least number of workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.
 How can I switch between workspaces that are under different email addresses?
 To add your workspaces from another email account, use the Add another account button in the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and follow the steps to login to your other account.

Chunk 1236:
Is there a limit to the number of accounts I can be signed into?
 There is currently no limit, although you may experience slower performance if you're logged into 10+ accounts at once.
 I forgot to log out of my account on a public computer, or my device was stolen.
 So sorry for the trouble 😓 If you're still logged in on a device you have access to, navigate to Settings → My account → Log out of all devices.
 If you no longer have access to your account, please send us a quick message to team@makenotion.com, or use the Notion AI face at the bottom right of the app. We can log you out remotely!

FAQs

Chunk 1258:
Are there any limitations to the type of content that search looks at?
 There's a few content types that search won't surface, unfortunately. We're always working on improvements, but here's a current list of limitations:
• Date mentions such as @Today or @last Tuesday will be included in search results, but other @mentions of pages and people such as @Doug or @Roadmap won't be included in search results.
• Comments and discussions are not included in search results.
• Property values such as select and multi-select tags are not included in search results. You can use database search for this though!

Chunk 1259:

Chunk 1260:
Is there a way to customize the preset filters, recent pages, or recent searches?
 Unfortunately, not at the moment. If you’d like, you can create your own list of frequently visited pages by selecting ⭐ at the top right of any page. This will pin the page to the top of your sidebar for quick access.

FAQs
 Can I switch between workspaces that are associated with different email addresses?
 To add your workspaces from another email account, use the Add another account button in the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and follow the steps to login to your other account. More on this here →
 My sidebar doesn't have any sections. How do I turn those on?

Chunk 1295:
The sidebar sections reflect the sharing settings of your account. If you have more than one person in your workspace, a Teamspaces section appears in the sidebar for your collaborative work with that person, and the Private section is there for your personal pages that are only visible to you.
 When I subscribe to a Plus Plan, does it cover all my workspaces?
 Paid plans only apply to one workspace, and don't cover the whole account. Workspaces are completely separate, so you won't be able to link any content between them.
 We recommend using the least number of workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.
 How can I migrate all my Notion content to a different workspace?

Chunk 1296:
Note: Any migrated content will be duplicated to the new workspace and these pages sometimes have issues. For more information, click here.
 To move your content from one workspace to another associated with the same account, click
•
•
• next to each of the top-level pages in your sidebar (or right click) and select Move to. At the bottom of the move menu, you’ll see a drop down to select a different workspace.
 When you move top-level pages, all their sub-pages go with them. They'll appear in the Private section but can be moved wherever you want to put them.
 What if I accidentally deleted something permanently? Any way to get it back?

Chunk 1297:
If you accidentally delete a page, a workspace, or even your entire account, we can help! Accidents happen 😅 Just send us a message in the app by clicking ? at the bottom left on desktop (or in your sidebar on mobile). Or email us at team@makenotion.com.
 We keep backups of our database, which allows us to restore a snapshot of your content in the past 30 days if you need it.
 How do I log out of my Notion account?
 Click on your current workspace's name at the very top left of your sidebar. Scroll to the bottom, and you'll see the option to Log out next to your email address.

FAQs
 Can I make Full width my default? Is there a way to set a default style for all pages?

Chunk 1337:
Not yet, but a lot of users have asked for this! We're continuing to keep this in mind for future projects.
 Can I justify text to be center aligned or right aligned?
 Notion doesn't have any traditional alignment options at the moment, unfortunately 😕But you can still make this happen. Drag and drop an empty line into the column next to your text to align it to the right or left.
 Is there a way to disable the menu that appears every time I type /?
 There's no way to turn this off by default for now, but you can press esc as soon as it pops up in order to dismiss it.
 How can I copy text from multiple blocks?

Chunk 1338:
On desktop, click and drag from the left or right page margin to select an entire block of content, or multiple blocks at a time. Click & drag from within a block to select, cut, copy & paste partial text across paragraphs, bullet lists, callouts & more — without having to select each block in its entirety.
 On mobile, double tap to select text, and drag your selection to include content across multiple blocks.

Columns
 Sometimes, it makes sense to put pieces of information next to each other. In these situations, you can format your text into columns (or create side-by-side sections with headings) using drag and drop:
• Click and drag the text you want to put in another column. (The ⋮⋮ symbol in the left margin is your handle for drag and drop.)
• Follow the blue guides that appear.
• Drop it where you want it. You just created a new column!
• You can create as many columns as you want across the width of a page.

Chunk 1343:

 You can create as many columns as you want across the width of a page.
 Note: Columns are available on tablet but not mobile. On your phone, you'll see the content in any right-hand column simply placed under the content in the left column.
Remove columns
 To remove columns, simply do the reverse of the action you took to create them.

Chunk 1344:
• Click the ⋮⋮ icon and hold to drag the content in your right-hand column back under or above the content in the left-hand column. When you see the blue guide span the width of the page, drop it and the columns should disappear.
• Sometimes, it's possible to have an empty column. In this case, click the ⋮⋮ icon and select Delete. This also removes the column format.

Table of contents
 If you're working on a long document with lots of headings, you may want to add a table of contents to help your readers and collaborators easily skim the page’s content and easily jump to any section.

Chunk 1350:
In a table of contents, you’ll see a list of all the headings used in your page. H2s and H3s will be indented to reflect your page’s structure. Click on any of the headings in your table of contents to go to that heading in the page.
 A table of contents can appear in a page in two ways:
• At the top of your page, as a block.
• At the right side of your page as you scroll through it, as a page-level setting.
 At the top of your page, as a block.
 At the right side of your page as you scroll through it, as a page-level setting.
Table of contents block
 There are a few ways to add a table of contents block in Notion:
• Hover over a new block on your page and select +. In the menu that appears, find and select Table of contents.

Chunk 1351:
• Enter / in a page and start typing table of contents. Select Table of contents in the menu that appears.
 Hover over a new block on your page and select +. In the menu that appears, find and select Table of contents.
 Enter / in a page and start typing table of contents. Select Table of contents in the menu that appears.
 Note: Your table of contents block is a single unit that must be moved, deleted, duplicated, and styled as a unit. To edit the text it contains, edit the actual headings on your page.
Table of contents page-level setting

Chunk 1352:
You’ll see a table of contents in the right side of your Notion page by default if your page has two or more headings. This table of contents will follow you as you scroll through the page so you can access it at any time. Hover over the table of contents to expand it and see all of the headings in your page.
 If you don’t want to see a page-level table of contents:
 In the page you want to remove the table of contents from, select
•
•
• .

Dividers
 Breaking up content on a page can help you separate distinct sections and ideas. Dividers are a good way to distinguish these sections and add some stylistic flair to your page.

Chunk 1353:
• Click the + in the left margin that appears when you hover over a new line and select the Divider block from the menu.
• Type / followed by div and then enter.

FAQs
 Why can't I see columns on my phone or tablet?

Chunk 1354:
Unfortunately, our mobile apps don't support multiple columns yet, but it's definitely on our to-do list!
 Will my table of contents show titles of in-line tables on my page?
 No. Even if you give your table a name in your document, this won't be reflected in the table of contents. You can, however, add a heading above the database that will appear.
 If I turn individual headings a color, will that show in my table of contents?
 Your table of contents will always be all one color 🖌You can change this color, and it will will apply to the whole thing. To do this:
• Click the ⋮⋮ icon that appears when you hover over your table of contents. Or select it and hit cmd/ctrl + /. Or right click.

Chunk 1355:
• Choose Color from the menu that pops up and select which color or highlight you want.

 Can I edit the text inside my table of contents?
 Not directly! In order to change the text it displays, edit the individual heading blocks in your page.

FAQs

Chunk 1377:
Can I make Full width my default? Is there a way to set a default style for all pages?
 Not yet, but a lot of users have asked for this! We're continuing to keep this in mind for future projects.
 Can I justify text to be center aligned or right aligned?
 Notion doesn't have any traditional alignment options at the moment, unfortunately 😕But you can still make this happen. Drag and drop an empty line into the column next to your text to align it to the right or left.
 Why can't I change text size on mobile?
 This styling option, along with page width, only exists on desktop and web.
 What's the ideal size and aspect ratio for cover images?

Chunk 1378:
The cover images are dynamic depending on the width of your window, so there's no specific size that works best. That said, we recommend using images at least 1,500 pixels wide.
 How can I insert an emoji in-line with my text 🤔?
 Anywhere in your text, type : followed by the name of the emoji you want to use, like :fire for 🔥 or :clappingfor 👏
 You can also use your system emoji picker to include emojis in-line on a Notion page, or anywhere else on your computer!
 Mac: ctrl + cmd + space
 Windows 10: windows key + . or windows key + ;

Notion makes it easy to link to all kinds of content in and outside of your workspace 🔗
• Inline in a paragraph
• As a block
• Link to a web page
• Backlinks
• Customize backlinks

Chunk 1401:
Link to a Notion page
Inline in a paragraph
 There are a few ways to link another Notion page inside a paragraph:
• @-mention: Type @, then start entering the name of the page you want to link. Find and select it in the menu that appears.
• [[ command: Type [[, then start entering the name of the page you want to link. Find and select it in the menu that appears.
• + command: Type +, then start entering the name of the page you want to link. Find and select it in the menu that appears.
 @-mention: Type @, then start entering the name of the page you want to link. Find and select it in the menu that appears.
 [[ command: Type [[, then start entering the name of the page you want to link. Find and select it in the menu that appears.

Chunk 1402:
+ command: Type +, then start entering the name of the page you want to link. Find and select it in the menu that appears.
As a block
 You can insert a link into a Notion page as a block so you can easily place it wherever you want in the page. To do this:
 In a page, enter the slash command /link. Alternatively, you can click the + that appears on hover to the left of any block, and select Link to page from the dropdown.
 Start entering the name of the page you want to link. Find and select it in the menu that appears.
 To move the block, click ⋮⋮ to the left of it and drag it to your desired location in the page.

Chunk 1403:
Note: When you add a Link to page block, the linked page will show up in your sidebar under the page where you inserted the link, just like any other sub-page.
Link to a block
 Every block in Notion has its own anchor link that can be copied and shared. These are great for directing someone's attention to a specific part of a long Notion page! To link to a specific block:
 Hover over the block and click the ⋮⋮ that appears to the left.
 Select Copy link. This will copy the URL of that specific block to your clipboard.
 Paste this URL anywhere — in a Notion page, a Slack message, an email, and more.
Link to a web page

Chunk 1404:
When you paste a web page’s URL into Notion, it can create a compact, easy-to-read link mention to help your page look nice and clean. You can even hover over the link to see a quick preview. To use a link mention in your page:
 Paste the URL.
 In the menu that appears, select Paste as mention.
 The web page will be displayed with an icon, the source, and the title of the page.
 Note:
• Link mentions work best with public web pages. Any links that require certain permissions or authentication to view won’t be pasted into Notion with any rich information.
• If your browser has cookies blocked, link mentions may not render properly.

Chunk 1405:
Link mentions work best with public web pages. Any links that require certain permissions or authentication to view won’t be pasted into Notion with any rich information.
 If your browser has cookies blocked, link mentions may not render properly.
 When you link to something inside of an app that integrates with Notion, Notion can generate a preview for it! Learn which platforms are supported here →
Backlinks
 Backlinks show you all the pages that link to the page you’re currently on. You can use these to navigate your workspace.
 Backlinks are created automatically every time you @-mention a page. To see a page’s backlinks, select {#} backlinks under its title, or its properties if it’s a database page.

Chunk 1406:
You will only be able to see backlinks for pages you have access to. Other people won’t see backlinks to your private pages. Backlinks to pages that are only visible to you will be labeled as Private.
Customize backlinks
 In any page, you can choose whether you want to display backlinks at the top and how you want to show them. To customize your backlinks:
 Select
•
•
• at the top of the page → Page options.
 Open the dropdown next to Backlinks.
 Select one of the following:
• Expanded: This will show you the full list of backlinks for your page.
• Show in popover: This will only show you the number of backlinks for your page, and you’ll have to click to see the full list of backlinks.

Chunk 1407:
• Off: This will hide any information about backlinks for your page.
 Expanded: This will show you the full list of backlinks for your page.
 Show in popover: This will only show you the number of backlinks for your page, and you’ll have to click to see the full list of backlinks.

FAQs
 How do I automatically open Notion links in the desktop app?
 Click on Settings & members in your sidebar.
 Select My settings.
 Toggle on Open links in desktop app.
 What's the difference between @-mentioning a page, and adding a Link to page block?

Chunk 1408:
Link to page works kind of like creating a sub-page. When you reference a Notion page this way, it will show up in your sidebar as a subpage of the page where it was linked.
 @-mentioning a page creates something more like a hyperlink. Pages you @-mention won’t show up as subpages of the pages they’ve been mentioned in.

• Verifying pages

Chunk 1412:
Sometimes it can be hard to get a detailed overview of everything going on with your team's documents. Wikis, page owners, and verified pages can help you quickly get the broad strokes of pages without needing to deep dive.
Create a wiki
 To turn a page into a wiki:
 Click the
•
•
• menu in the top right corner.

•
•
• menu in the top right corner.
 Select Undo wiki.
 There are three default views of a wiki. You can create additional views, including views with other layouts like a calendar, timeline, or list.

• Home: Default wiki view that can be customized like any standard Notion page.
• All pages: Database view of all the pages within this wiki. Best for getting a broad view of documents.

 To change page owner:
 Click on the specific page

Chunk 1414:
Click on the current owner’s name
 Search or select the new owner’s name
 Or, from a database view:

 Click on a page you own.
 Click on the Verification section at the top.
 Choose whether you want to verify the page for a specific date or indefinitely. Page owners will be notified to re-verify the page.
 Or, from a database view:

FAQs
 I tried duplicating some blocks, but got a Please try again later error.
 This error means that you've hit our duplication rate limit — right now you can only duplicate 20,000 blocks per hour. Our apologies for the incovenience!
 If you wait a bit, you'll be able to duplicate the content then 👍
 What if I accidentally deleted something permanently? Any way to get it back?

Chunk 1440:
If you accidentally delete a page, a workspace, or even your entire account, we can help! Accidents happen 😅 Just send us a message in the app by clicking ? at the bottom left on desktop (or in your sidebar on mobile). Or email us at team@makenotion.com.
 We keep backups of our database, which allows us to restore a snapshot of your content in the past 30 days if you need it.
 How can I empty my trash?
 There isn’t a way to empty your trash all at once. You can go in and delete individual pages from the trash — otherwise, pages in the trash will be automatically and permanently deleted after 30 days.
 Enterprise plan workspace owners may customize these settings. Learn more here →

• Add a math equation inline
• Edit an inline equation
• Recognized symbols
 Notion uses the Ka Te X library to render math equations, which supports a large subset of La Te X functions.
Add a math equation as a block
 Click the + that appears to the left when you hover over a new line. Scroll down and choose Block equation in the dropdown. Alternatively, type /math and press enter.

Chunk 1467:
With the new equation block in place, click inside it to type or paste your equation, or use cmd/ctrl + enter/return.
Add a math equation inline
 Just like you can format text in Notion as bold, strikethrough, or code notation, you can also format your text as a math equation, like this quadratic formula:
 There are a few different ways to add math equations inline, and all are keyboard friendly.
 With text shortcuts:
• Type two dollar signs, followed by your equation. When you close your formula with two more dollar signs, it will turn into an equation.
 Type two dollar signs, followed by your equation. When you close your formula with two more dollar signs, it will turn into an equation.
 With the equation input:

Chunk 1468:
To open the equation input, use the keyboard shortcut ctrl/cmd + shift + E.
 Type your equation into the input, and press enter.
 With the formatting menu:
 Highlight an equation in your paragraph.
 Click the √x button in the formatting menu that appears, or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl/cmd + shift+ E. Your selected text should turn into an equation.
Edit an inline equation
• You can edit an existing equation by clicking on it. This will open the equation input, and any changes you make to the equation will reflect live on your page.

Chunk 1469:
• You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate to an equation. The equation input will open when your cursor passes over the equation, and the equation input will close if you continue pressing the arrow key in the same direction.

Recognized symbols

Chunk 1470:
Notion supports the full scope of symbols and operations within the \Ka Te X language. For a full list of supported functions, please visit the links below:
 Supported Functions · Ka Te X
 Support Table · Ka Te X
 Note: Ka Te X spans most, but not all mathematical notation supported by La Te X. If your equation isn't rendering correctly in Notion, please visit the links above to see if that function is supported.
FAQs
 I don't know La Te X but want to use Notion's equations. How can I get started?
 It's easy to get started using La Te X for homework, class notes, or lab reports. Basic arithmetic and variable names are valid in La Te X already.

Chunk 1471:
If you just need to look up specific symbols, Detexify is a great resource that allows you to draw the symbol and look up the corresponding La Te X code.
 To learn more powerful La Te X, Overleaf documentation is a great place to learn the basics:
• Subscripts and superscripts
• Brackets and Parentheses
• Fractions and Binomials
• Aligning Equations
• Spacing in math mode
• Integrals, sums and limits
• List of Greek letters and math symbols
• Mathematical fonts
 Mathematical expressions
 Subscripts and superscripts
 Brackets and Parentheses
 Matrices
 Fractions and Binomials
 Aligning Equations
 Operators
 Spacing in math mode
 Integrals, sums and limits

Chunk 1472:
Display style in math mode
 List of Greek letters and math symbols
 Mathematical fonts
 Note that Overleaf is a full-featured La Te X editor, so not everything in the documentation is supported in Notion. If in doubt, you can always check this list of Supported Functions or alphabetized Support Table to determine which functions are supported.
 Why can't I render a specific equation? What formulas/libraries do you support? Can you add support for a formula or library I want to use?

Chunk 1473:
Notion uses the Ka Te X library to render equations. Ka Te X supports a large subset of La Te X, documented on their list of Supported Functions and alphabetized in this Support Table. To request support for new functions or environments, you can open an issue on the Ka Te X Git Hub project.
 I'm trying to use the align environment and it's not working!
 From the Common Issues page of the Ka Te X documentation:
 "Ka Te X does not support the align environment because La Te X doesn't support align in math mode. The aligned environment offers the same functionality but in math mode, so use that instead."
 Can I use inline equations for superscript and subscript?

Chunk 1474:
It's possible to use inline equations for superscript and subscript, but it does mean that the text will be an equation, in "equation font."
• Use ^ to designate superscript, for example: x^2
• Use _ to designate subscript, for example: H_2O
 Use ^ to designate superscript, for example: x^2
 Use _ to designate subscript, for example: H_2O
 If there are multiple characters that you want to include in superscript or subscript, wrap them in curly brackets. For example: 23^{rd}
 What happens when I copy/paste inline La Te X?
 It will give you the source code.
 How do I use Notion for chemistry?

Chunk 1475:
Notion supports the \\ce and \\pu chemical equation macros from the mhchem extension. These shortcuts allow you to typeset beautiful chemical and mathematical equations quickly and easily.
 How do I convert between inline and block equations?
 If you have a block containing an inline equation, you can use the "Turn into" menu to make it a block equation.

Databases are collections of Notion pages that help you organize information in a variety of ways. With multiple database views to choose from, you control how to display and search your content.
Intro to databases

Chunk 1512:
Databases in Notion are collections of pages. Here, we'll introduce you to the general structure of a database, walk you through the different menus and options, and deep dive into how to open and edit pages within a database. 🗃
Views, filters & sorts
 You can view the same database in multiple ways, and switch back and forth between them depending on your needs. Within a view, you can add filters and sorts to easily categorize your content 📁
Database properties
 Database properties add all kinds of context to your database items, like due dates, task owners, relevant URLs, last edited timestamps, and more. Use these properties to filter, sort, and search your data 🧩
Relations & rollups

Chunk 1513:
Have you ever wanted to connect the data between two tables? You're in luck! Notion's relation property is designed to help you express useful relationships between items in different databases 🛠
Customize your database
 Tailor your database to your needs with lots of customization options to choose from ✨
Database templates
 Most databases contain the same types of pages created over and over again. Think of weekly meeting notes, bug reports, or design specs. To make this easy, database templates let you define and replicate certain page structures with one click 🖨
Database automations
 Improve your efficiency by automating the most tedious parts of your work 🔁
Intro to formulas

Chunk 1514:
In a Notion database, you can add a formula property that lets you run all kinds of calculations and functions based on other properties. You can use formulas to manipulate existing data and arrive at many other helpful values 🔮
Formula syntax & functions
 Notion formulas can operate on various properties and functions. Here, you'll find a list of them ➗
Sub-items & dependencies
 Use sub-items and dependencies to give depth to any workflow 🐣
Task databases & sprints
 Help your team stay on track with task databases and sprints 💪
Data sources & linked databases
 Need to reference database content somewhere else in your workspace? Linked databases let you show, filter, and sort the same source data across multiple locations ⛓

Chunk 1515:
Optimize database load times & performance
 Here’s how to make sure your databases are always feeling quick and snappy 🏃🏼
Table view
 A table is the classic database view, but tables in Notion are more than just rows and columns. Each row opens up into its own page, and can contain whatever properties you want 📊
Board view
 Boards are helpful for showing items in a database moving through stages of a process, or grouped by property. Use them for project management and visualizing your data 📋
Timeline view
 For anyone who needs to visualize their projects plotted chronologically - whether it's hours, years, or anything in between - Notion's timeline is a type of database that keeps you on task and on track ⏳
Calendar view

Chunk 1516:
Calendars let you visualize how database items connect to certain dates. Use one when you want a bird's-eye view for important launch dates, multi-day events, or even projects spanning multiple months 🗓️
List view
 Lists are simple and minimalist database views. They're ideal for storing notes, articles, and documents that don't need too many properties. Every item in a list is a page that can be opened with one click and store as much content as you need 📜
Gallery view
 Gallery view is the best way to display databases with visual components, like mood boards, office directories, virtual recipe boxes, and more 🖼️
Chart view

Chunk 1517:
Charts help visualize the vast amount of information in your database. Customize your charts so you can see your data in the way that’s most helpful. You can even put charts from multiple databases into a Notion page to create a powerful dashboard 📊
Unique ID
 Add an extra layer of project management by giving your tasks their own IDs 🤖

Databases in Notion are collections of pages. Here, we'll introduce you to the general structure of a database, walk you through the different menus and options, and deep dive into how to open and edit pages within a database. 🗃

Chunk 1521:
• Create a database
• Full page vs. inline databases
• Add and open database pages
• Item options
• Collaborating in a database
• "Can edit content" permission level
• Lock views
 There are three things that make Notion databases unique:
 Every item is its own page: Every item you enter into your database is a Notion page. Open a database item to add more information in the form of text, images, and more, as you would with any other Notion page!
 You can customize properties: Add properties to contextualize, label, and augment any database item with things like dates, status, and links. Learn more about database properties here →

Chunk 1522:
You can toggle between multiple views: Your data isn't limited to a table. Visualize the information in a database as a list, calendar, chart, and more — whatever makes the information most useful. Learn more about views, filters, and sorts here →
A tour of databases
 Every full page database has the same menus and sets of options. Here's a quick walkthrough.
 Views: Edit and switch between all the different views of your database. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view to see your other views.

Chunk 1523:
Add a new view: Add a new view to your database, with its own layout, filters and sorts. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and select Add view.
 Filter menu: Apply filters based on property values. When you apply a filter to a database, only you can see it to start, but you can save them to the view for your entire shared team if you prefer!
 Sort menu: Sort your data by a property. Like filters, sorts are only visible to you by default, but you can make them visible to your whole team as well.
 Database search: Type in any word, whether it's in the name of a database item or in a property, and your database will only show items that fit that search query.

Chunk 1524:
•
•
• menu: Located at the top right of your database, this allows you to edit your view layout, grouping, properties, and more.
 Create a new database page: Click this to add a new page to your database. Depending on your screen size, this may appear as + or New. Open the dropdown next to this button to access and edit any database templates you've configured.
Create a database
 To create a database in Notion, open a new or existing Notion page and type / followed by the type of database view you’d like to start with, like table or board.
 When you create a database, you can start from scratch or pull in data from another part of your workspace.

Chunk 1525:
• If you want to use the same properties or an existing view of a database, we suggest selecting an existing data source. Search for an existing database and then choose the one you'd like to use.
• If the information you're adding to the database doesn’t exist anywhere else in your workspace, we suggest creating a new data source.

Chunk 1526:
• Full page databases appear just like any other page in your sidebar.
• You can lock a full page database so that other people can't change properties and value options by selecting
•
•
• at the top of your database → Lock database.
• To turn a full page database into an inline database, drag the database into another page in the sidebar, which will turn it into a subpage. Then navigate into the page, and select ⋮⋮ → Turn into inline.

Customize database pages
 The top section of any page in a Notion database can include several things:

Chunk 1536:
Properties provide data about the page you're looking at, like project owner, due date, tags, and more.
 Comments capture conversation between you and your teammates. You can use them to tag each other, ask questions, provide feedback and more.
 Backlinks indicate all the pages that link to the current page so you can easily navigate between them.
 As with everything in Notion, you can customize the look and feel of these components. To access these options:
 Click the
•
•
• at the top right of any Notion page in a database and select Customize page.
 For properties, you can use this menu to choose which property fields you want to show at the top of the page, and how. For each one, select from:

Chunk 1537:
• Always show: Nothing changes, you continue to see the property field.
• Hide when empty:  The property field will disappear from the top of your page if it has no value in it.
• Always hide: The property field will not show up at the top of your page.
 Always show: Nothing changes, you continue to see the property field.
 Hide when empty:  The property field will disappear from the top of your page if it has no value in it.
 Always hide: The property field will not show up at the top of your page.
 You can also access the Customize page menu by clicking the ⋮⋮ icon next to any property in the list at the top of your database page. This ⋮⋮ icon can also be clicked and dragged up or down to reorder how properties are displayed on your page.

Chunk 1538:
Tip: If you have a database with dozens of properties, hiding some properties is a great way to keep your pages clear.
 Note: When you hide properties, they get aggregated in a single menu item at the bottom of the list. You can click this to easily show any hidden properties.
 For backlinks, you can choose:
• Expanded: See all the pages that link to the current page listed in full.
• Show in popover: In case you don't want to see all the pages, you can choose to see just the number of backlinks. Click to open a popup displaying all the pages.
• Off:  Just hide all backlinks entirely.
 Expanded: See all the pages that link to the current page listed in full.

Chunk 1539:
Show in popover: In case you don't want to see all the pages, you can choose to see just the number of backlinks. Click to open a popup displaying all the pages.

Collaborating in a database
 When using a database in a shared workspace, Notion has features in place to prevent accidental edits that could impact other teammates.
"Can edit content" permission level

Chunk 1540:
Click Share at the top of a database to see and manage all users' permission levels. Learn more about sharing and permissions here →
 The Can edit content permission level is only found on database pages, and allows users to:
• Create, edit, and delete pages within the database.
• Edit property values for those pages.
 Create, edit, and delete pages within the database.
 Edit property values for those pages.
 Users with Can edit content permissions in a database will not be able to:
• Add, edit, or remove database properties or views.
• Change filters or sorts.
• Lock or unlock the database.
 Add, edit, or remove database properties or views.
 Change filters or sorts.
 Lock or unlock the database.

Chunk 1541:
Note: Users with Can edit content access will still be able to create linked databases and edit views, sorts, and filters in that linked database. Learn more about linked databases →
Lock views
 Find this option in the
•
•
• menu at the very top right of the Notion window. Switch it on to prevent anyone from changing properties and views in your database. They'll still be able to edit the data it contains.
 Note that anyone with editing access can toggle this lock on or off at any time. This is helpful as a quick safeguard against accidental edits in a database that you'd like many people to be able to change structurally.

Types of database views
 There are six different ways to visualize your content within a database. Here's a high level overview of each layout:
• Table: Tables allow you to see your database pages as rows, with every property represented by a column.
• Board: This view groups your items by property. For example, you could use it as a Kanban board to move tasks from one status to another as you make progress on them.

Chunk 1546:
• Timeline: Use your database to plot project milestones on a timeline so you can see when they’re happening and how long they’ll take to complete.
• Calendar: Calendar view displays your items based on their Date property.
• List: Lists are a very clean, minimal layout of your database items.
• Gallery: This view is useful for highlighting images. You can edit your gallery to show images contained in the Files & media property — otherwise, the gallery will show any content that the database page contains.
• Chart: This view visualizes your database items in a bar, line, or donut chart so you can easily analyze and report on the data.

Chart: This view visualizes your database items in a bar, line, or donut chart so you can easily analyze and report on the data.
Create and switch between views
 When you first create a database, you'll need to choose the layout of the default view. After this, you can create a new view by selecting + next to your existing views. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and select Add view.
 You can also provide others with information by giving your view a description. To do this:
 Select a view → Edit view.
 Select ⓘ next to your view’s name, then enter your description.
 When you hover over a view, you will see its description.

Chunk 1549:
You can reorder your views by dragging them. If you have a lot of views, you can select {#} more... next to your views to do this.
 In your sidebar, views show up as nested items inside any full page database. You can tell they are views because they'll have a
• to their left. Click on any view in your sidebar to jump right to it.
Customize your database views
 When you’re in a given view, click its name to rename, duplicate, delete, copy its link, or edit its components. You can also edit view components by clicking the
•
•
• at the top right of the database.
 Each view of the database has several components that you can customize:
• Layout: Choose how you want your database to be visually organized.

Chunk 1550:
• Properties: Show or hide database properties for each view.
• Filters: Add criteria based on property values to show or hide data.
• Sorts: Sort by a property to change the order that pages are displayed in.
• Groups: Group your data by the values in a property.

Link to your database view
 You can copy an anchor link to this specific view of your database so you can share it elsewhere.

Chunk 1551:
Click the
•
•
• icon at the top right of your table.
 Click Copy link to {view} and the URL will copy to your clipboard so you can paste it.
Open pages as
 Within each view, you can choose how you'd like database pages to open. There are three options:
• Side peek: Open pages on the right side of the database. The rest of the database view continues to be interactive on the left.
• Center peek: Open pages in a focused, center modal.
• Full page: Open pages as full pages directly.
 Side peek: Open pages on the right side of the database. The rest of the database view continues to be interactive on the left.

To change the setting per view, click the
•
•
• at the top right of your database, and open the Layout menu.
 Scroll down and change the Open pages in setting.
 Note: Table, Board, List & Timeline layouts will open pages in side peek by default. Gallery & Calendar layouts will open pages in center peek by default.
Filters
 Notion makes it easy to filter your database so it only displays the items that meet specified criteria, i.e. have (or don't have) certain properties. These filters can be as simple or complex as you like!
Add a filter
 To filter the entries you see in a database view:
 Click Filter at the top of your database.
 In the dropdown that appears, choose the property you'd like to filter by.

Chunk 1553:
This filter will now show up at the top of your database. Click the filter icon to see and edit all of the filters that have been applied to your database.
 Add another filter by clicking the filter icon. You can have as many filters as you'd like!
 Note: In a shared database, any changes you make to filters and sorts in views won’t affect other people on the team until you click Save for everyone.
Add an advanced filter
 You can create more specific database views and combine AND and OR logic by using filter groups. These can be nested up to three layers deep! Here's how:
 Click the filter icon at the top of your database → Add advanced filter.

Chunk 1554:
A new menu will pop up. Here, you can choose the properties that you'd like to filter by, and customize the AND and OR logic of the advanced filter.
 In the example below, we're filtering the table view of our Roadmap so that all the entries have to meet the criteria that include both AND and OR logic.
 Tip: You can quickly turn a filter into a filter group by clicking the
•
•
• to the right of the filter, and selecting Add to advanced filter.
Sorts
 You can sort your database so that items are displayed based on properties appearing in ascending or descending order.
 For example, you can order them based on priority, or last edited, or alphabetically.
 Click ⇅ at the top of your database.

Chunk 1555:
In the dropdown that appears, choose the property you'd like to sort by.
 This sort will now show up at the top of your database. Click to edit it.
 You can add as many sorts as you want, or remove them by clicking the X to their right.
 Change the order that multiple sorts are applied by dragging them up or down using ⋮⋮.
 Note: Different properties sort by different logic, depending on their value type.
• Text properties such as Name and Text sort alphabetically.
• Number properties sort numerically.
• For Select and Multi-select properties, you get to define what sorting order means. Click on the property, then drag options up or down to set the sort order.
 Text properties such as Name and Text sort alphabetically.

Chunk 1556:
Number properties sort numerically.
 For Select and Multi-select properties, you get to define what sorting order means. Click on the property, then drag options up or down to set the sort order.
Groups
 You can group your database by different properties on your table to visualize them in different ways.
 Click the
•
•
• menu and find Group. You can group by nearly any property type.
 The database will now group by values of that property. Each group includes a 👁️ to the left, so you can quickly hide groups and focus on what you need.
 You can sort your database groups by selecting Sort and choosing to sort manually or sort by the options provided (alphabetical, ascending, and more).

Chunk 1557:
Empty groups can also be hidden from view with the Hide empty groups toggle.
Search your database
 You can search for specific content in your database.
 Click 🔎 at the top right and type the word(s) you're looking for in page titles or properties.
 You'll see your database change in real-time to only show the items that fit that criteria.
Freeze column
 If you have a large database, it's probably tedious to keep moving back and forth between properties to compare their data.
 Instead you can freeze one column, which will cause it to stay visible on the left side no matter where you scroll in the database.
 To freeze a column, click the name of the column and click Freeze up to column.

Chunk 1558:
To unfreeze a column, click the name of the column and click Unfreeze column.

Database buttons
 Database buttons automate your workflows so you don’t have to spend as much time manually updating your database. For example, you could use a button to approve a document or mark a daily habit as complete. Buttons can be added to your database as a property, and when a button is clicked, it’ll take actions on database pages so you don’t have to.
 To add a database button property:

Chunk 1565:
Select
•
•
• at the top right of your database → Properties → New property → Button.
 Add a label for your button, like Approve or Complete.
 Add an action for your button. This is the action you want to have taken when the button is selected. Multiple actions can be taken using one button. You can select from:
• Add page to...: This will add a page to a database of your choice.
• Edit pages in...: This will edit properties for pages in a database of your choice.
• Show confirmation: This will show a message to the person who has selected the button before any further action is taken. You could pair this with another action so that you can be more careful with edits made to your database.

Chunk 1566:

What is a database relation?
 Let's say you have two databases for your theoretical business 😉
• One that tracks items purchased
 One that tracks customers
 One that tracks items purchased
 You want to know both which customers bought which items, as well as which items were purchased by which customers. This is a job for relations!

Chunk 1583:
• In the two tables above, the columns labeled ↗ Items Purchased and ↗ Customers are relation properties, which can be added like any other database property.
• Here, when you add an item bought into the Customers database, the customers who bought them automatically appear in the ↗ Customers column in the Items database.

 Here, when you add an item bought into the Customers database, the customers who bought them automatically appear in the ↗ Customers column in the Items database.
Example use cases

Chunk 1584:
• Connect your database of restaurants with your database of neighborhoods so you can see which restaurants are in which neighborhoods at a glance.
• Connect your database of meeting notes with your database of clients to provide quick access to the notes relevant to each client.
• Connect your database of tasks with your database of bigger projects to understand how projects are broken down into tasks, and how tasks contribute to projects.
• Connect your database of candidates with your database of interviewers to keep track of who interviewed whom.
 Connect your database of restaurants with your database of neighborhoods so you can see which restaurants are in which neighborhoods at a glance.

Chunk 1585:
Connect your database of meeting notes with your database of clients to provide quick access to the notes relevant to each client.
 Connect your database of tasks with your database of bigger projects to understand how projects are broken down into tasks, and how tasks contribute to projects.
 Connect your database of candidates with your database of interviewers to keep track of who interviewed whom.
Create a relation
 To relate two databases, you need two databases. So let's assume you've made the Customers and Items databases above for the purpose of this walkthrough.
 Add a new column/property to your Customers database and give it a name, like Items Purchased.
 Search for Relation.

Chunk 1586:
Then, search for the database you want to create the relation with.
 You'll see a preview of the relation. In this case, we've created a relation from the Customer database to the Items database.
 Click the blue Add relation button to finalize the creation of the new relation property.
 Now when you click in a cell in this relation column, you'll bring up a menu where you can search for and choose items from the other database to add.
• For example, this is how you can add which clothes each customer bought.
• To add an item, click the name in the list. To delete an item, hover over and then click the – button on the right.
 For example, this is how you can add which clothes each customer bought.

Chunk 1587:
To add an item, click the name in the list. To delete an item, hover over and then click the – button on the right.
 Tip: To change the database you're connecting to, re-select Relation as the property type for that particularly property. You'll be prompted to choose a new database.
Two-way relations
 Relations are created as one-way by default. But you can easily toggle on a corresponding relation in the destination database.
 With two-way relations, the edits work both ways! So if you add a customer to the Items database in the relation column, the change pops up in your Customers database.
 Follow the above instructions to create a new relation property.

Chunk 1588:
Click the toggle that says Show on [name of related database]. In our example, this says Show on Items DB.
 Give this corresponding relation a name.
 Below, you'll see a preview of the two-way relation. In this case, we've created a relation from the Customer database to the Items database, and a relation from the Items database to the Customer database.
 Click the blue Add relation button to finalize the creation of these two new relation properties.
View and remove related pages
 When you create a relation, you're essentially adding Notion pages stored in one database into the property field of another.

Chunk 1589:
• These pages can be opened and edited like any other! Click on the page in the relation column. Then click on it again in the window that pops up.
• You can also remove any related page by hovering over and clicking the – at the right.
 These pages can be opened and edited like any other! Click on the page in the relation column. Then click on it again in the window that pops up.
 You can also remove any related page by hovering over and clicking the – at the right.
• You can choose to limit the number of pages that can be included in your relations property – with the option to select 1 page or to have No limit.

Chunk 1590:
• If you select the option to limit it to 1 page, people using your database will only be able to select 1 page in the relation. This is especially useful for situations where only one page should be related to one another, for example - if only one order number should be associated with each purchase.
 You can choose to limit the number of pages that can be included in your relations property – with the option to select 1 page or to have No limit.

Chunk 1591:

This is especially useful for situations where only one page should be related to one another, for example - if only one order number should be associated with each purchase.
Display options for relations
 Relations can be displayed on pages in three different ways.
 To change the display:
 While on a database page, click on the relation.
 Click Show as and select one of the following:
• As property: The relation will be displayed at the top of the page, alongside all the page properties.

Chunk 1592:
• As page section: The relation will be displayed right above the page body, as its own section. Best option if you want the relation to standout.
• Minimal: The relation will be display right above the page body, but with the content hidden.

Customize displayed properties for relations

Chunk 1593:
When you set up a relation in your database, you can also choose to display certain properties of linked pages. For example, let’s say you have a database of frequently asked questions at your company. Each FAQ has a relation to a page that further explains the answer to the question. You might want people to also be able to see the owner of each page, so they know who to reach out to with more questions. You can set your FAQ database up so that the owner is visible along with the relevant page!
 To do this:
 Open a page in a database that has a relation property.
 Click the field next to that property to link a page → click
•
•
• .

Chunk 1594:
In the menu that appears, drag the properties of the related database into or out of Shown in relation or Hidden in relation.
 Once you’re done, you’ll see your desired properties appear in the relation field. This will apply to all of the pages in your current database.
Relate a database to itself
 Let's say you want items in the same database to have relationships with each other. For example, you have a tasks database and you want each task to relate to other tasks.
 Start off by creating a new relation.
 Then search for and choose the database you're currently working in.
 You'll now see that the database is related to This database.

Chunk 1595:
Just as with relations between two databases, you can choose to make this a one-way relation or two-way relation.
 To make it a two-way relation, toggle on Separate properties. You'll see a second property show up.
Rollups
 Rollups help you aggregate data in your databases based on relations. Going back to our customers and items example above, let's say you wanted to know how much each customer spent based on what they bought.
 First, create the relation so you know who bought what.
 Add a new column/property and choose Rollup from the Property type menu. Give it a descriptive name.

Chunk 1596:
• Clicking on any cell in the rollup column will bring up a new menu asking you for:The relation property you want to roll up.The property of those related pages you want to roll up.The calculation you want to apply to them.
• The relation property you want to roll up.
• The property of those related pages you want to roll up.
• The calculation you want to apply to them.
• So, for our example, you'd choose to roll up the relation property Items Purchased and the Price property within those pages. Then you'd choose Sum as the calculation.Doing this adds up the prices of each item related to a customer's name, giving you the total dollars they spent in your rollup column.

Chunk 1597:
• Doing this adds up the prices of each item related to a customer's name, giving you the total dollars they spent in your rollup column.
 Clicking on any cell in the rollup column will bring up a new menu asking you for:
• The relation property you want to roll up.
• The property of those related pages you want to roll up.
• The calculation you want to apply to them.
 The relation property you want to roll up.
 The property of those related pages you want to roll up.
 The calculation you want to apply to them.
 So, for our example, you'd choose to roll up the relation property Items Purchased and the Price property within those pages. Then you'd choose Sum as the calculation.

Chunk 1598:
• Doing this adds up the prices of each item related to a customer's name, giving you the total dollars they spent in your rollup column.
 Doing this adds up the prices of each item related to a customer's name, giving you the total dollars they spent in your rollup column.
Rollup types
 There are different calculations you can apply as a rollup. Here are all of them:
• Show original: This just shows all related pages in the same cell. It's the same as the relation property itself.
• Show unique values: This shows each unique value in the selected property for all related pages.
• Count all: Counts the total number of values in the selected property for all related pages.

Chunk 1599:
• Count values: Counts the number of non-empty values in the selected property for all related pages.
• Count unique values: Counts the number of unique values in the selected property for all related pages.
• Count empty: Counts the number of related pages with an empty value for the property selected. So, if one item a customer bought didn't have a price and that was the property selected, the rollup column would say 1.
• Count not empty: Counts the number of related pages with assigned values for the property you selected.
• Percent empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with no value in the property you selected.
• Percent not empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with a value in the property you selected.

Chunk 1600:
Show original: This just shows all related pages in the same cell. It's the same as the relation property itself.
 Show unique values: This shows each unique value in the selected property for all related pages.
 Count all: Counts the total number of values in the selected property for all related pages.
 Count values: Counts the number of non-empty values in the selected property for all related pages.
 Count unique values: Counts the number of unique values in the selected property for all related pages.
 Count empty: Counts the number of related pages with an empty value for the property selected. So, if one item a customer bought didn't have a price and that was the property selected, the rollup column would say 1.

Chunk 1601:
Count not empty: Counts the number of related pages with assigned values for the property you selected.
 Percent empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with no value in the property you selected.
 Percent not empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with a value in the property you selected.
 These rollup calculations are only available for Number properties:
• Sum: Computes the sum of the numeric properties for related pages (like above).
• Average: Computes the average of the numeric properties for related pages.
• Median: Finds the median of the numeric properties for related pages.
• Min: Finds the lowest number in the numeric property for related pages.
• Max: Finds the highest number in the numeric property for related pages.

Chunk 1602:
• Range: Computes the range between the highest and lowest numbers in the numeric property for related pages (Max - Min).
 Sum: Computes the sum of the numeric properties for related pages (like above).
 Average: Computes the average of the numeric properties for related pages.
 Median: Finds the median of the numeric properties for related pages.
 Min: Finds the lowest number in the numeric property for related pages.
 Max: Finds the highest number in the numeric property for related pages.
 Range: Computes the range between the highest and lowest numbers in the numeric property for related pages (Max - Min).
 These rollup calculations are only available for Date properties:

Chunk 1603:
• Earliest date: Finds the earliest date/time in the date property for all related pages.
• Latest date: Finds the latest date/time in the date property for all related pages.
• Date range: Computes the span of time between the latest and earliest dates in the date property for related pages.
 Earliest date: Finds the earliest date/time in the date property for all related pages.
 Latest date: Finds the latest date/time in the date property for all related pages.
 Date range: Computes the span of time between the latest and earliest dates in the date property for related pages.
Aggregate rollups

Chunk 1604:
In both tables and boards, you can apply calculations to your rollup column to get a sense of sums, ranges, averages, etc. for your entire database.
• Let's say you want to find the total money spent by all customers in our example.
• At the bottom of your Customers table, under your rollup column, click Calculate.
• Choose Sum to add all the values in that column together and get a grand total.
 Let's say you want to find the total money spent by all customers in our example.
 At the bottom of your Customers table, under your rollup column, click Calculate.
 Choose Sum to add all the values in that column together and get a grand total.
FAQs
 Can I export or import relations?

Chunk 1605:
When you export a relational database as a CSV file, the relation properties will export as plain text URLs. For now, you can't re-import that CSV back into Notion to re-establish the relations with other databases.
 Can I duplicate a database with a relation?
 Yes, but the following will happen which can be kind of confusing:
 If you create a copy of the Customers database in the example above, you'll see a new relation property automatically appear in the Items database.
 This happens because relations sync two ways in Notion. When a database is duplicated, you also duplicate its relationships with other databases. You'll get the hang of it! 💪
 Can I rollup a rollup?

Chunk 1606:
Unfortunately not, as this could create unintended loops. We recommend sticking to rolling up other properties 😊

• Use a database template
• Repeating database templates
• Nesting database templates
• Edit, duplicate, or delete an existing template
Create a database template
 To create a template inside a database, click the dropdown arrow next to New at the top right of your database. Then, select + New template.
 When editing a new or existing template, you'll see a bar across the top indicating which database it's located in.

Chunk 1615:
Whatever you title this page will be the name of the template you use going forward. For instance, you might title this one Bug.
 On this page, you can define properties for your template. For example, you can create a template for bug reports that automatically puts P1 in the Priority property and assigns the user Fig to the Product Manager property. You can also add content in the page itself.
 Templates can contain any type of content, including images, embeds, and sub-pages. Whatever you choose will show up identically on each page created with the template.
 Note: If you add a relation property to a template, do not fill it in unless you want every page you create with that template to relate to the same existing page(s).

Chunk 1616:
Use a database template
 Create a new page in your database and choose any of the templates from the gray menu it contains.
 You can also click the dropdown menu on the right of the blue New button at the top right of your database. Choose any template you've created to generate that type of page.
 Give the page a unique title.
 Once you've created a new page with a template, you can make any changes you want to the content that appeared.
Repeating database templates
 Repeating database templates automatically create a copy of a template in your database however often you would like.
Create a repeating database template
 To create a repeating database template:

Chunk 1617:
Open the dropdown next to New or + (depending on your screen size) at the top of your database.
 Next to the database template you want to repeat, select
•
•
• .
 Open the dropdown next to Repeat.
 You can make your template repeat daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. Indicate how many weeks, months, or years you want in between repeats, as well as your start date and the time you want your database template to be repeated.
Nesting database templates
 You may want to create a database inside of a recurring database template, with that database having templates of its own. While this is possible, be mindful of the limitations:

Chunk 1618:
• You can’t nest a template within a template that recurs daily. You can only nest a template within a template that recurs weekly, monthly, or yearly.
• You can only have three levels of nesting per database template.

FAQs

Chunk 1619:
Are the templates I create in one database available in all other databases in my workspace?
 No, they're only available in the specific database where you created them. For every new database you create, you can define new templates.
 How do relation properties work with templates?
 While you can create relation properties in database templates, we don't recommend that you define them unless you want every page of a certain type to be related to the same page(s).
 Is there a limit to the number of database templates I can make?
 Nope! You can make as many as you want.

• Database automation triggers
• Database automation actions
• Edit, pause, or delete database automations

Chunk 1623:
Database automations are sequences of actions that happen any time a specific change to a database occurs. Automations consist of both triggers (the events that initiate the automation) and actions (the effect of the automation). Database automations are meant to help save you time and simplify your work, and can be very basic or more complex depending on your needs.
 Database automations can be used for many things, including:
• Assigning a task to a specific person when its status changes.
• Sending a Slack notification to a channel when a page is added to a database.
 Assigning a task to a specific person when its status changes.
 Sending a Slack notification to a channel when a page is added to a database.
 Note:

Chunk 1624:
• Database automations are available on paid plans on all platforms. Free plan users can create Slack notification automations and use, but not edit, existing automations in templates.
• Database automations can be created, edited, or deleted by anyone with full access to the database. Slack automations are the only exception. These can only be edited by the automation creator.
• Automations won’t take action on any pages whose access is restricted. You can check and change page access in the share menu.

Chunk 1625:
• Database automations can't be triggered by other automations. Button actions, however, can trigger database automations. For example:A recurring template automation will not trigger a database automation.A database automation creating a page in another database will not trigger a database automation.A user clicking a button that creates a page will trigger a database automation.
• A recurring template automation will not trigger a database automation.
• A database automation creating a page in another database will not trigger a database automation.
• A user clicking a button that creates a page will trigger a database automation.

 Give your database automation a name if you’d like.
 Add triggers. Learn more about the types of triggers below →
 Add actions. Learn more about the types of actions below →
 Select Save.

Chunk 1628:
Did you know you can also add a button property to your database? With the click of a button, actions can be taken on your database on your behalf. Learn more here →
Database automation triggers
 Automations can have one trigger or multiple triggers. When you set up an automation, you can decide whether the automation will take place When any of these occur or When all of these occur.
 Note: If you have multiple is edited triggers that must all occur for your automation to take place, those triggers need to happen within a small window of about three seconds. If they don’t, your automation may not be triggered properly. To avoid this, you can:
• Create separate automations for each trigger.

Chunk 1629:
• Use a more specific trigger than is edited, like is set to or contains.
 Create separate automations for each trigger.
 Use a more specific trigger than is edited, like is set to or contains.
 You can choose from two types of triggers: Page added or Property edited.
 If you choose a Property edited trigger, you can indicate which properties from your database will trigger the automation.

Chunk 1630:
For name, person, number, text, select, and relation properties, you can choose what kinds of edits made to that property will trigger an automation. For example, you might have a list of contacts in a Notion database and set up an automation where the trigger is a phone number starting with the numbers 732, and the action is that person’s state being set to New Jersey.
 You can also have more than one condition for your trigger so that two or more things must be true for the automation to occur.
Database automation actions
 Automations can take one action or multiple actions. You can choose from a variety of actions:
• Edit property will edit the properties of pages in the database you are currently in.

Chunk 1631:
• Add page to will add a page to a database of your choosing, and edit the properties of that page.
• Edit pages in will edit pages and properties in a database of your choosing.
• Send notification to will send a notification to specific people in your Notion workspace. Your recipient can be up to 20 people in your workspace, or people who are associated with a certain People property in your database. Add a message that you want to go along with the notification.
• Send Slack notification to… will send a notification to the Slack channel you want.
 Edit property will edit the properties of pages in the database you are currently in.
 Add page to will add a page to a database of your choosing, and edit the properties of that page.

Chunk 1632:
Edit pages in will edit pages and properties in a database of your choosing.
 Send notification to will send a notification to specific people in your Notion workspace. Your recipient can be up to 20 people in your workspace, or people who are associated with a certain People property in your database. Add a message that you want to go along with the notification.
 Send Slack notification to… will send a notification to the Slack channel you want.
 If you choose an Edit property trigger, you can indicate how you want those properties to be updated.

Chunk 1633:
For multi-select, people, and relation properties, you can add or remove individual values instead of adding or removing all values at once. For example, you might have a task database where if the task name contains the word “blog”, your name is added to the people property, even if there are other people already assigned to that task.

Edit, pause, or delete database automations
 To see and manage all of the automations for a database:
 Click ⚡ at the top of a database.
• This ⚡ will only appear if you have active automations.
 This ⚡ will only appear if you have active automations.
 Hover over the automation and click
•
•
• .
 Select Edit, Pause, or Delete.
FAQs

Chunk 1634:
How frequently is the database scanned for “changes” in properties?
 Database automations work over a three second window. For example, within this three second window, a user can remove a trigger and delete any changes, resulting in no property change to the automation.
 Do automations work on pages in the entire database, or pages in a single database view?
 Either one. During the creation process, you can specify if the automation should run on pages in the entire database, or in a specific view. If any filters in that view change, the automation will then apply to the adjusted list of pages.
 Can guests with full access to a database create automations?
 Unfortunately, guests can't create database automations.

 Formulas 2.0
 We've recently updated our formula language! Your existing formulas will be automatically migrated for this update and should behave the same.
 For more information, check out our guide:
• How to use Notion’s new and improved formulas with your existing setups
 How to use Notion’s new and improved formulas with your existing setups
 Notion’s formula syntax might look familiar if you’ve done any programming before! You’ll choose functions (which accomplish different tasks) and inputs (data to manipulate). An output (the result) will be computed and displayed in the new formula property for every row in your database.

Chunk 1640:
For example, in this formula: date Subtract(prop("Date"), 14, "days")
• The function is date Subtract()
• date Subtract() takes in a date, number, and then a unit text, which can be "days", "hours", etc.
• The inputs are Date (property), 14 (number), and "days" (unit of time).
• The output will be a date representing 14 days before your Date property

Formula editor
 Notion’s formula editor contains several helper features to assist in writing formulas.

Chunk 1641:
• The editor automatically provides suggestions of functions or properties based on what's in your formula.You can navigate this suggestions panel with up & down arrows and use Enter to accept a suggestion.
• You can navigate this suggestions panel with up & down arrows and use Enter to accept a suggestion.
• Long formulas will wrap once you’ve exceeded the width of the editor, but you can also use Shift + Enter to create a new line!To navigate between lines, you can use alt/option + up/down.
• To navigate between lines, you can use alt/option + up/down.

Chunk 1642:
• If you open the formula editor from a database row, you'll see a live preview of the result of the formula for that row.Note that the result preview will not display line breaks, which can be added using "\n" in the formula, e.g. "Hello" + "\n" + "World"
• Note that the result preview will not display line breaks, which can be added using "\n" in the formula, e.g. "Hello" + "\n" + "World"
• The editor will display errors and highlight the erroneous code, so you can better identify the source of issues.

• Create a sprint
• Plan a sprint
• Complete a sprint

Chunk 1686:
• Sprint settings
 Task databases and sprints help your team easily manage time-boxed work and stick to a schedule.

 A task database in Notion is a type of database that requires a status, assignee, and due date property to help you track the work that you need to get done.
 To create a task database or turn an existing database into a task database:
 Open your database and select
•
•
• at the top.
 Select Customize {your database's name}.
 Search for Tasks.

 Pick which properties in your database will correspond with the task status, assignee, and due date. If your database doesn’t already have these properties, you can create them by selecting Create new.
 Select Turn into task database.

Chunk 1687:
Any tasks assigned to you from that database will appear in My tasks. My tasks is a widget inside Home that helps you track your tasks across all task databases in your workspace in one place. Learn more here →
Turn a task database into a regular database
 If you no longer want a database to be a task database:
 Open your database and select
•
•
• at the top.
 Select Customize {your database's name}.
 Search for and select Tasks.
 Select Remove.
Create a sprint
 To use Sprints, you must have a Task database in Notion. You can turn any database in Notion into a Task database following these instructions.
 Once you have a Task database, you can add Sprints to your set-up. To do this:
 Open your database and select
•
•
• at the top.

Chunk 1688:
Select Customize {your database's name}.
 Search for Sprints.
 Select Add next to Sprints.
 Select Turn on sprints.
Sprint board and sprints database
 Once you turn on sprints for your database, a few items will be created to help you track them. These will be accessible in your Notion sidebar, alongside the original database you used to set up sprints.
 The Sprint board is where you can track all of the tasks belonging to your current and future sprints, using a few different views:
• Current Sprint: Shows tasks in the current sprint.
• Sprint planning: Shows tasks in the current, next, and last sprint, as well as any tasks not yet assigned to a sprint.
• Backlog: Shows tasks not assigned to a sprint.

Chunk 1689:
Current Sprint: Shows tasks in the current sprint.
 Sprint planning: Shows tasks in the current, next, and last sprint, as well as any tasks not yet assigned to a sprint.
 Backlog: Shows tasks not assigned to a sprint.
 The Sprints database will give you a general view of your current and future sprints. You can open any sprint's page to view the tasks within. You'll also notice a Timeline view, which gives you a more linear look at your sprints.
 If you’ve accidentally deleted the Current Sprint view and want to recreate it:
 Set up a view in the original task database that you’d like to use as your Current Sprint view.
 Select
•
•
• at the top right → Customize {your database's name} → Sprints → Manage sprint from this view.
Plan a sprint

Chunk 1690:
In the Sprint board, go to the Sprint planning view.
 Move any unfinished tasks from your current sprint or from the backlog into the next sprint.
Complete a sprint
 To mark a sprint as complete:
 In the Sprint board, go to your Current sprint.
 Select Complete sprint.
 You'll be asked to confirm the dates of your next sprint and what you'd like to do with the incomplete tasks from your current sprint. You can move them to the next sprint, move them to your backlog, or keep them in the current sprint.
 Select Complete Sprint.
 Alternatively, you can seamlessly transition from one sprint to the next by setting sprints to automatically complete. Learn about how to set your sprints to automatically complete and begin below →

Chunk 1691:
When you complete a sprint:
• The status of your Current sprint will be changed to Last. Whichever sprint was currently assigned to Last, if there is one, will now be set to Past.
• The status of the Next sprint will be changed to Current.
• The tasks on the board will reflect the new Current sprint.
• The Next sprint will be created if none exists.
 The status of your Current sprint will be changed to Last. Whichever sprint was currently assigned to Last, if there is one, will now be set to Past.
 The status of the Next sprint will be changed to Current.
 The tasks on the board will reflect the new Current sprint.
 The Next sprint will be created if none exists.
Sprint settings

Chunk 1692:
Customize your sprints to fit your needs. To do this, go to your sprint board and select
•
•
• → Customize {your database's name} → Sprints. From here, you can adjust the following:
• Duration: Choose how many weeks (from one to eight) you want each sprint to run for.
• Start on: Choose which day of the week you want your sprints to begin on. If you change this in the middle of an active sprint, the current sprint’s dates will change. For example, if your sprints used to run for two weeks starting on Mondays, but you want your sprints to run for two weeks starting on Thursdays, your current sprint will run until two weeks after the upcoming Thursday, so that your next sprint can begin on Thursday as you indicated.

Chunk 1693:
• Incomplete tasks: Choose what will happen to any incomplete tasks from your sprints. You can put them in the next sprint, move them to your backlog, or keep them in their original sprint.
• Automated sprints: Turn this on if you want sprints to complete automatically before the next one is automatically created and started.
• Turn off sprints: Choose this to turn off a sprint. Once you turn sprints off, your sprints database, sprint board, and relations between tasks and sprints will be permanently deleted. If you choose to turn sprints on again, you’ll start with a brand new database, board, and relations.

Automated sprints: Turn this on if you want sprints to complete automatically before the next one is automatically created and started.
 Turn off sprints: Choose this to turn off a sprint. Once you turn sprints off, your sprints database, sprint board, and relations between tasks and sprints will be permanently deleted. If you choose to turn sprints on again, you’ll start with a brand new database, board, and relations.
 Note:
• You can’t adjust the dates in your sprints database because these dates are either populated based on the settings above, or set when you manually complete a sprint.

Chunk 1696:
• If you need to break your sprint cadence temporarily, like for the holidays, we suggest turning off automatic sprints and waiting until you’re ready to resume your normal sprint cadence before starting your next sprint.

Need to reference database content somewhere else in your workspace? Linked databases let you show, filter, and sort the same source data across multiple locations ⛓
• Create a linked database

Chunk 1700:
• Edit linked databases
Choosing a data source
 When you make a database, you’ll be given the option to select an existing data source from the workspace or to a create a brand new one.
 We suggest selecting an existing data source if you want to use the same properties from another database, or an existing view living elsewhere in your workspace. Search for an existing database and then choose the one you'd like to use.

Chunk 1701:
We suggest creating a new data source if the information you're adding to the database is completely new and doesn’t exist anywhere else in your workspace, or if you want to keep it separate from other data. To create a new database, click New table, New list, etc. (depending on the type of view you are creating) in the menu that appears.
Create a linked database
 Think of each linked database as a two-way excerpt of the source database. It references the same source data, but has its own views, filters, and sorts.
 In a page, type /linked and press enter.
 A menu will pop up that allows you to type to search for specific databases in your workspace. You can also scroll to browse.

The database you select will show up as a copy of the original, which you can filter, sort, and view differently without changing the original.
Edit linked databases
• When interacting with a linked database, the views, filters, or sorts you create and delete will not affect the views on the original database.
• However, edits you make to the actual content or properties of a linked database will be reflected in the original.
• You can add as many linked databases as you would like inline on a single page. Filter them for different purposes to create your own dashboard.

FAQs
 I tried sharing a page with a linked database, but the recipient wasn't able to see it.
 Whoever you share this type of page with needs to have access to the original database to be able to see any linked excerpts of that database.
 Can I name my linked database something different from the original database?
 Not at the moment. We've had a few users ask about this though, so it's on our to-do list!

Here’s how to make sure your databases are always feeling quick and snappy 🏃🏼
• Things you can do to speed up your database setup
• Avoid building too many databases into high-traffic pages

Chunk 1707:
• Minimize the number of filters and sorts on formulas and rollups
• Filter on simple properties
• Delete any unused pages
 We’re always working to improve your experience with Notion, and we appreciate your feedback and patience. If your databases aren’t feeling very fast when you use them, there are a few reasons why this might be happening, and a few ways you can make improvements.
Things that can slow your database down
• Number of pages: If your database has a ton of pages, it might be slower to load.
• Number of properties: The more visible properties your database has, the longer it might take to load.

Chunk 1708:
• Complex sorts and filters: If your database has a sort or filter on properties like title, text, formula, or rollup, the logic behind it can make load times longer.

 Complex sorts and filters: If your database has a sort or filter on properties like title, text, formula, or rollup, the logic behind it can make load times longer.
Things you can do to speed up your database setup
Avoid building too many databases into high-traffic pages

Chunk 1709:
If you have a large workspace, avoid having lots of inline databases, like dashboards, in high-traffic pages. The more simultaneously viewed databases, the more stress on your setup.
 Try housing each database in its own page first. Once you’ve done that, if you’d like all of the databases to be displayed in one page, you can:
 Type /linked in that page and select Linked view of a database to create a linked database.
 Create database views in this linked database and configure them to point to your desired source databases. Different database views can point to different source databases!

Chunk 1710:
When using a single linked database, only one database view is open at a time, and therefore only that one database is listening for updates. You should see an improvement in performance with this setup.
Avoid complex reference chains
 Formulas and rollups are extremely powerful, but the more complex they are, the slower your database may be. For example, a formula that depends on several other formulas that each depend on rollups may take longer to calculate.
Minimize the number of filters and sorts on formulas and rollups
 Databases that are filtered and sorted on formula and rollup properties may take a bit longer to load.
Filter on simple properties

Chunk 1711:
Adding filters based on simple properties such as select, multi-select, status, number, and date may improve the speed of your database. Even if you have complex filters, this may help by reducing the number of pages that need to be processed.
Hide unnecessary properties
 If some properties are less important in your database view, hiding them may improve responsiveness and interactivity.
Delete any unused pages
 We suggest removing any unnecessary or duplicative pages from your database to keep it as simple and up-to-date as possible. If that’s not an option for you, adding a filter on the Created time property to filter out old pages may significantly improve performance for very large databases.

FAQs
 Is there a way to add background colors to specific cells? Or conditional formatting?
 Not at the moment, unfortunately. It's a popular feature request though, so definitely on our radar! For the time being, you can use Select and Multi-select properties to add a pop of color to your table 🎨

Chunk 1729:
Why can't I delete the Name property?
 Our tables are a lot different than traditional spreadsheets, since each row represents a database entry that can be opened as its own page, or visualized in other database views. The Title property gives you access to database pages. That said, you can drag the column left or right to re-order it however you want!
 Is there a way to skip the modal view, and always Open as Page by default?
 Yes!

FAQs
 Is there a way to add conditional formatting? Like change the color of projects plotted on my timeline or background color of cells in the table?
 Not yet, unfortunately. It's a popular feature request though, so definitely on our radar! For the time being, you can use Select and Multi-select properties to add a pop of color to your timeline 🎨

Chunk 1773:
Why can't I delete the Name property when showing table in my timeline?
 Timelines are essentially databases, and databases are essentially lists of items. That's what goes in the Name property. All the other data points contained are attributes of these items, like due dates, owners, tags and more. You can't remove the Name property because that's the core information contained. You can, however, rename that property to align with whatever you are working on.
 Is there a way to skip the modal view, and always Open as Page by default?
 Yes!
 Click the
•
•
• at the top right of your database.
 Under Layout, click Open pages in and select Full page.
 Does Notion have simple (non-database) tables?
 Yes! Learn more about simple tables here →

Chunk 1774:
How can I turn a full page database into an inline database?
 If it's not already, drag the database from your sidebar into another page. It will become sub-page
 Go to that page, click the ⋮⋮ button next to the database sub-page and select Turn into inline.
• Click the ⋮⋮ button and select Turn into page to change it back.

Your X and Y axes won’t be able to show rollups, buttons, unique IDs, files and media, or formulas resulting in a list of outputs. Certain formulas, like formulas based on relations and rollups and other complex formulas, may cause charts to take a little bit longer to load.
 The X and Y axes of your chart can be configured to show you what’s most important. To configure your X axis:
 With your chart view open, select
•
•
• at the top of your database.
 Under X axis, you can adjust the following:
• What to show: Choose the property that should be associated with your X axis. Let’s say you want the X axis to show your tasks by status.

Chunk 1814:
• Sort by: Choose how your data should be sorted. For example, you might want to sort by ascending status (going from to-do to complete). You can also control what’s shown or hidden from your chart by selecting 👁️ next to any of the options under Visible groups. For example, you might choose to exclude any tasks marked as complete from your chart if you’re only looking to visualize your in-progress tasks. Anything that’s hidden will move to Hidden groups.

Chunk 1815:
• Omit zero values: Depending on your setup, you may or may not see this option. Toggle this on or off depending on whether you want to include property values for which there are no associated items. For example, let’s say you have a status for paused tasks. If there aren’t any tasks in your database that are paused, you can toggle Omit zero values off if you don’t want the paused status shown in your chart. If you toggle on Omit zero values, you’ll see all of the status options in your chart, even if there are no tasks for some of those status options.

 To configure your Y axis:
 With your chart view open, select
•
•
• at the top of your database.
 Under Y axis, you can adjust the following:

Chunk 1818:
• What to show: Choose the property that should be associated with your Y axis. You can also choose to show Count, which would show you the number of items associated with your X axis.
• Group by: Choose the property that you want to group your Y axis by. You can also choose None if you don’t want any grouping.

Chunk 1819:
• Omit zero values: Depending on your setup, you may or may not see this option. Toggle this on or off depending on whether you want to include property values for which there are no associated items. For example, let’s say you have a status for paused tasks.

If you toggle on Omit zero values, you’ll see all of the status options in your chart, even if there are no tasks for some of those status options.

Chunk 1820:
• Cumulative: You’ll see this option if your chart is showing Count or Sum and your X axis property is sorted in ascending order. Toggle on Cumulative if you want your chart to reflect the total amount of information gathered over time. Toggle off Cumulative if you want the chart to reflect the data for the current moment in time. For example, let’s say you have a chart where you’re tracking how many tasks you have completed. You completed two tasks yesterday, and three tasks today. If Cumulative is toggled on, you’ll see two tasks completed yesterday, and five tasks (two from yesterday, three from today) completed today. If Cumulative is toggled off, you’ll see two tasks completed yesterday, and three tasks completed today.

Chunk 1821:
What to show: Choose the property that should be associated with your Y axis. You can also choose to show Count, which would show you the number of items associated with your X axis.

 Your workspace might contain other members like teammates, friends, or anyone else you want to work with on pages. There are a few ways to share Notion pages with all members of your workspace:

Chunk 1851:
• Hover over the name of a default teamspace in your sidebar and create a new page inside of that teamspace by clicking the + that appears.
• In your sidebar, drag a page into a default teamspace.
• Select Share at the top of a page and in the dropdown at the bottom of the menu, select Everyone at {your workspace}.
 Hover over the name of a default teamspace in your sidebar and create a new page inside of that teamspace by clicking the + that appears.
 In your sidebar, drag a page into a default teamspace.
 Select Share at the top of a page and in the dropdown at the bottom of the menu, select Everyone at {your workspace}.

Chunk 1852:
Note: A default teamspace is a teamspace that everyone in a workspace must be a part of by default. To find out if a given teamspace is a default teamspace:
 Select
•
•
• next to the name of a teamspace in your sidebar.
 Select Teamspace settings.
 In the Members tab, look for Permissions. If you see Default, this means that teamspace is a default teamspace.
Share with a teamspace
 Teamspaces are dedicated spaces for every team within your organization or company. Each teamspace has its own members and permission levels, which can be customized by its teamspace owners. Learn more about adding members and assigning permissions in teamspaces →
 There are two ways to share Notion pages with any teamspace that you’re a member of:

Chunk 1853:
• Hover over the name of a teamspace in your sidebar and create a new page inside of that teamspace by clicking the + that appears.
• In your sidebar, drag a page into a teamspace.

 In your sidebar, drag a page into a teamspace.
Share with individuals or groups
 Sometimes you'll want to share a page with only select members of your workspace — like a meeting doc for 1:1s with your manager, or notes for a small project team. To share a page with specific people:
 Select Share at the top of any page.
 Find and select the names of the members/groups in your workspace that you want to share the page with.

Chunk 1854:
Open the dropdown next to the names of the people you’re inviting, then select a permission level.
 Select Invite.
 Pages shared with select workspace members will appear in the Shared section of your sidebar. Learn more about sidebar sections here →
Share with guests
 You can invite people from outside your workspace to access certain Notion pages as guests. This could be useful if you want to share a Notion page with a contractor you've hired, or a client you’re working with. Learn more about guests here →
 To share a page with a guest:
 Select Share at the top of the page.
 Enter the email address of any guest you want to invite.
 Select a level of access for that guest from the dropdown and select Invite.

Chunk 1855:
Your invited guest will receive an email with a link to the page.
 If they don't already use Notion, they can sign up to access your page.
 Note: If you’re on an Enterprise plan and the owner has prevented members from inviting guests to pages, then any people you invite to a page will automatically be added as members. Before you select Invite in the steps above, you can hover over your guest’s name or email for more information on how that person will be added to the page.
Share to the web
 You can easily turn your Notion page into a beautiful website with Notion Sites. Learn more about how to share your page with the web here →
Stop sharing

Chunk 1856:
Seeing other people in a page you didn't mean to share? Want to make a page private? There are a few ways you can stop sharing your pages with others:
• In your sidebar, drag a page into your Private section so that only you can see it.
• Select Share at the top of the page, and switch off access for your workspace, individuals, groups, or the public. You can also select Remove from the dropdown next to any of these.
• To remove guests from pages, click Share on the top of the page and find the guest's name. Click Remove.
 In your sidebar, drag a page into your Private section so that only you can see it.

Chunk 1857:
Select Share at the top of the page, and switch off access for your workspace, individuals, groups, or the public. You can also select Remove from the dropdown next to any of these.
 To remove guests from pages, click Share on the top of the page and find the guest's name. Click Remove.
Permission levels
 For every person, group, or teamspace you share a page with, you can assign a different permission level. This helps to keep private information private and gives you granular, precise control over your work.
 Here are the different permission levels in Notion:
• Full access: People with full access to a page can edit any of the content it contains and share the page with anyone they want.

Chunk 1858:
• Can edit: Select this level of access for people who should be able to edit the content on the page, but not share the page with others.
• Can edit content: This permission level is only found on database pages. People with this level of access can create and edit pages within the database, and edit property values for those pages. However, they will not be able to change the structure of the database and its properties, views, sorts, or filters. Learn more about databases here →
• Can comment: Select this level of access for people who should only have the ability to comment on a page. They won’t be able to edit or share the content.

Chunk 1859:
• Can view: People with this level of access can read the content on the page, but they won’t be able to comment, edit, or share.
 Full access: People with full access to a page can edit any of the content it contains and share the page with anyone they want.

 Can view: People with this level of access can read the content on the page, but they won’t be able to comment, edit, or share.
 There are also different actions that people can take in a workspace depending on their role in the workspace. To learn more, read this article →
Edit permission levels
 Note: If someone has requested a change in their permissions on a page you own, you’ll be able to see, approve, and reject those requests from your Inbox.
 To change someone’s permission level for a specific page:
 Select Share at the top of the page.

Chunk 1861:
Open the dropdown next to the name of a person, group, or teamspace with whom the page has been shared.
 Select a permission level.
Inherited permissions
 When you create a subpage inside of a page, that subpage will take on the permissions of its parent page. To change this, go into a subpage and update the permissions there.
 Teamspace owners can set default permissions for content in their teamspace. This will apply to every new page created in the teamspace, and if you want to change them, you’ll have to make changes at the page level.
Permission overrides

Chunk 1862:
Notion respects the broadest level of access given to a user. For example, let's say you give Member A Can view permissions to a page. Then you give everyone in your workspace Full access, Member A will also get full access because they are member in your workspace.
 Additionally, moving a shared page to the Private section of your sidebar will remove everyone else's access on that page. Note: This override will only apply to the parent page — the permissions granted for any subpages will remain the same.
 If a page is set to be accessible to Anyone with link, note that even those that don’t have the direct link may be able to access in certain cases including the following:

Chunk 1863:
• The page is mentioned in or linked from another page shared more broadly.
• The page uses a two-way relation that links to another page shared more broadly.
• The page is nested inside another page that has been shared more broadly.
 The page is mentioned in or linked from another page shared more broadly.

See who's sharing a page
 You can tell who else has access to a page because their profile photos can be seen in the bar at the very top of the page.
• An avatar appears faded out if that person is not currently looking at the page.

Chunk 1864:
• An avatar appears unfaded if the person is currently on the page.
• Hovering over an avatar will show you the person's name, email, and when they were last on the page.
• Clicking on an active avatar will jump you to the part of the page where they're reading or typing.
• When people are collaborating on the same page at the same time, you'll see their avatars move next to the blocks they are looking at or editing.
• Click
•
•
• at the top right of any page and look at the bottom of the menu that pops up. You'll see who last edited the page and when.

Request access
Request access to a page
 If you open a page that you don’t have access to, you can select No access on the page to send a request. This will notify the page’s creators or editors, who can choose to accept or deny your access request.

Chunk 1866:
Request edit access
 If you have view or comment access to a page and want edit access:
 Open the page and select Share.
 In the Share tab, you’ll see what level of permissions you currently have. Open the dropdown next to this information.
 Select Request edit access.
 This request will go to the page creator, who can accept or ignore it. You’ll be notified once your request has been accepted — try refreshing the page if you’re not able to edit it.
Enterprise security settings
 If you’re a workspace owner on an Enterprise Plan, you can control content sharing with additional security settings. Learn more about these features here →
 To see these settings, go to Settings & members in your sidebar, then select Security & data.
FAQs

Chunk 1867:
I tried adding a guest to my workspace but they were turned into a member automatically. How can I prevent that?
 If your workspace is above the guest limit for your plan, new users that you share content with will be automatically added as a member (instead of as a guest) if they have the same organization email domain.
 To allow for a new user with the same organization email domain to be added as a guest, you will need to remove existing guests to fall below your plan limit, upgrade to a plan with a higher limit, or work with our sales team (for eligible customers).

Chunk 1868:
If your workspace is above the guest limit for your plan, you may have the Allowed Email Domains setting turned on. When enabled, this feature allows people with that email domain to join your workspace as a member automatically. You can disable this setting in the Settings tab of Settings & Members in the left sidebar.
 I want to share a page with a client, but they don't use Notion.

Chunk 1869:
You can enable Share to the web in the Share menu, and share the URL with them. As long as you keep the Search engine indexing setting disabled (always disabled by default), only people with that exact URL will be able to access the page. They'll be able to view the page, even if they don't have a Notion account. However, they won't be able to make any edits, leave comments, or sort/filter a database.
 My Export button is missing, it doesn't appear in any menus.
 You may have the Disable Export setting enabled in the Settings tab of Settings & Members in your left sidebar. You'll need to be an admin in your workspace, and on desktop to change this.

Chunk 1870:
Can I limit access to different parts of a database? Can you make it so that some people can see certain database views or properties, but not others?
 Unfortunately, database permissions don't get quite that granular yet 😓 It’s a legit use case though, and definitely something we want to support in the future. Stay tuned!

Who’s who in a workspace
 There are several ways users can interact with a Notion workspace:

Chunk 1875:
• Members: People in your company or organization who can create and edit Notion pages, but can’t change any settings. These are colleagues or people who you work with across a large portion of your workspace.
• Guests: People external to your company or organization who can be invited to individual Notion pages, but not an entire workspace. These are people who aren’t part of your team that you may want to work on specific pages with.
• Workspace owners: Admins who can manage workspace settings, delete a workspace, and manage other workspace owners, admins, members, and guests.
• Membership admins (Enterprise Plan only): People who can add or remove members from workspaces or groups. They don’t have access to workspace settings.

Chunk 1876:
Members: People in your company or organization who can create and edit Notion pages, but can’t change any settings. These are colleagues or people who you work with across a large portion of your workspace.
 Guests: People external to your company or organization who can be invited to individual Notion pages, but not an entire workspace. These are people who aren’t part of your team that you may want to work on specific pages with.
 Workspace owners: Admins who can manage workspace settings, delete a workspace, and manage other workspace owners, admins, members, and guests.
 Membership admins (Enterprise Plan only): People who can add or remove members from workspaces or groups. They don’t have access to workspace settings.

Chunk 1877:
Note: Depending on how your workspace owner has adjusted your workspace’s security settings, members may or may not by able to request adding guests or members. Additionally, users may or may not be able to request to be added to a workspace as a member.
Members
 Members are individuals in your company or organization. These could be colleagues at the same organization or people who read, edit, and comment on a lot of the same pages in a workspace.
 To manage your workspace members, go to Settings & members → People or Members (depending on your plan). Here, you’ll see:
• A list of active members of your workspace.
• What teamspaces and groups they belong to.
• Each member’s role in the workspace.

Chunk 1878:

 What teamspaces and groups they belong to.
 Each member’s role in the workspace.
Add a member
 Note: On paid plans, you'll be charged per member in your workspace. For more information on plans, go here →
 With email
 Go to Settings & members → People or Members (depending on your plan).
 Go to the Members tab.
 Select Add members and type the email address of the person you want to add. If you don't have invite access, you will instead have the option to request to add a member.
 Select whether to add them as a Workspace owner, Membership admin, or Member from the dropdown, then press Invite.
 They'll receive an email with a link to sign in and join your workspace.
 Using a link

Chunk 1879:
Go to Settings & members → People or Members (depending on your plan).
 Go to the Members tab.
 Select Copy link to copy the secret link to your clipboard, and share with anyone you’d like to invite to work with you.
 When an invited user clicks on the secret link, they'll be able to join your workspace automatically as a paid member, without you having to add their email address manually.
 If you don’t want to be able to invite people to your workspace with a link, turn off the toggle next to Invite link.
Change a member's role
 Go to Settings & members → People or Members (depending on your plan).
 Go to the Members tab.
 Select the dropdown for a member’s role, then select Workspace owner, Membership admin, or Member.
Remove a member

Chunk 1880:
Go to Settings & members → People or Members (depending on your plan).
 Go to the Members tab.
 Depending on your plan:
• Select the dropdown for a member’s role, then select Remove from workspace.
• Select
•
•
• next to a member, then select Remove from workspace.

• next to a member, then select Remove from workspace.
 Workspace owners can also remove other workspace owners from the workspace.
 Note:

Chunk 1881:
• When you remove a member from a workspace, that person will instantly lose access to the workspace, and pages from the Private section of their left sidebar will be hidden from view. If you invite that member back to the workspace, their private pages will be unhidden.
• If a user has left and rejoined a workspace within the last 30 days, their private pages, shared pages, group membership, and teamspace membership will be restored upon rejoining the workspace.
 When you remove a member from a workspace, that person will instantly lose access to the workspace, and pages from the Private section of their left sidebar will be hidden from view. If you invite that member back to the workspace, their private pages will be unhidden.

Chunk 1882:
If a user has left and rejoined a workspace within the last 30 days, their private pages, shared pages, group membership, and teamspace membership will be restored upon rejoining the workspace.
Allowed domains & auto-joining
 If you're using Notion at your company, you can make it easy for anyone to automatically join your workspace as a member when they sign in with their work email.
 Go to Settings & members → Settings.
 Under Allowed email domains, enter any email domain that you want to grant access to automatically, like your company's email domain. You can add multiple allowed domains in this field, but you'll only be able to add domains that workspace members' accounts are under.

Chunk 1883:
Now, whenever someone signs into Notion with an email that has one of those domains, they'll see the option to join your workspace during onboarding. If the user joins your workspace, they will become a member of your workspace and you will be billed accordingly.
Guests
 Note: Unlike members, guests are free to invite to your workspace as long as you stay within your plan’s guest limit. If your workspace is above this limit, any new users that you share content with will be automatically added as members and not guests if they have the same organization email domain.

Chunk 1884:
To ensure you’re adding users as guests and not members, you’ll need to remove existing guests so you’re below your limit, upgrade to a plan with a higher limit, or work with our sales team (for eligible customers).
 Guests are individuals external to your company or organization who you invite into your workspace on a page-by-page basis. For example, guests could be:
• People who have a different organization email domain.
• Contractors or interns who are working with you temporarily.
• Clients who you want to provide feedback on your work.
• Friends, family, or mentors that you want to have contribute to or review your work.
 People who have a different organization email domain.
 Contractors or interns who are working with you temporarily.

Chunk 1885:
Clients who you want to provide feedback on your work.
 Friends, family, or mentors that you want to have contribute to or review your work.
 Guests have the same capabilities as members, except:
• They can't be given workspace-wide access. They must be invited to individual pages in order to view them and their sub-pages.
• They can't create new pages outside of the ones they have access to.
• They can't be added to groups of members.
• They can't adjust workspace settings or billing information.
• They can't add new members to your workspace.
• They can't add new integrations to your workspace.
 They can't be given workspace-wide access. They must be invited to individual pages in order to view them and their sub-pages.

 They can't be added to groups of members.
 They can't adjust workspace settings or billing information.
 They can't add new members to your workspace.
 They can't add new integrations to your workspace.
Add a guest
 On any page you want to share with a guest:
 Go to Share at the top right.
 Enter the email address of any guest you want to invite.
 Select a level of access for that guest from the dropdown and press Invite.
 Select Skip for now to make sure you’re adding them as a guest and not a member.
 They'll receive an email with a link to the page.
 If they don't already use Notion, they can sign up to access your page.

Chunk 1887:
Note: If you’re on an Enterprise plan and the owner has prevented members from inviting guests to pages, then any people you invite to a page will automatically be added as members. Before you select Invite in the steps above, you can hover over your guest’s name or email for more information on how that person will be added to the page.
 Allow and approve access requests from guests
 To make it easier for you to add guests to your workspace, Notion also allows people outside of your workspace to request access to certain pages in your workspace. This feature is available and turned on by default for all plans except Enterprise.
 If you’re on a Personal Pro, Plus, or Business Plan and you want to turn this setting off:

Chunk 1888:
Open Settings & members → Security.
 Toggle off Allow page access requests from non-members.
 Free plans will not be able to turn this feature off.
 Once the guest submits a request to access a page, a notification will be sent to the inbox of the page’s creator. The page creator can approve the request as well as adjust the level of access for that guest, or they can ignore the request.
 Note: When you add someone to a page, they can automatically access all of its sub-pages by default. That being said, you can restrict or expand sub-page permissions!
Request adding guests
 Members of a workspace can request to add guests to it. This feature is available on Enterprise Plans only, and only workspace owners can enable or disable it.

Chunk 1889:
Enable guest requests
 Go to Settings & members → Security.
 Make sure Disable members inviting guests to pages is turned on, then turn on Allow members to request adding guests. Workspace owners can Disable guests without removing existing guests from the workspace. They still have the option to remove all existing guests if desired.
 Once this is turned on, members will have to submit a request before they can invite a guest. Workspace owners are exempt and can continue to invite guests directly.

Chunk 1890:
Note: Allow members to request adding guests is a workspace level setting, and will override the any teamspace level guest setting. This means if a teamspace allows guests, but the workspace has enabled guest requests, members will have to submit guest invite requests to add guests to pages in the teamspace.
 Request to invite a guest
 If you're a workspace owner, you can invite guests directly.
 If you're a member:
 Navigate to the page you want to invite a guest to. Just like with regular sharing, you must have full access permissions on the page to request to invite a guest.
 Select Share and type the name of the guest you want to invite.
 Select the role you want the guest to have.
 Select Invite.

Chunk 1891:
A notification will be sent to your workspace owner about your request, along with the page, role and email of the guest you requested. You will also receive confirmation that your workspace owner has been notified.
 Approve a guest
 Guest invite requests must be approved on a per page, per guest basis. Only workspace owners can view and approve guest requests. Each request will have the email of the guest, the member who requested it, the role that was requested, and the name of the page.

Chunk 1892:
A workspace owner can approve or reject a request to invite a guest directly from the notification they receive, or by going to by going to Settings & members → Members → Guests and finding the requests at the top. Once a workspace owner responds to a request, the member who submitted will be notified of the decision.
Change guest access levels
 Once you've added a guest to a page, you can always change their level of access later. To change a guest's access level:
 Go to Share at the top right. You'll see the page's guests listed in the dropdown menu.
 Click the menu to the right of a guest's name. Choose which level of access you want to grant that guest from the following options:
• Full access: They can edit and share the page.

Chunk 1893:

• Can comment: They can only read and comment, not edit or share.
• Can view: They can only view the content, and can't share it.
• Remove: Revokes their access to the page.

Share a teamspace with groups
 Teamspaces are a dedicated area for every team within your organization or company, and can be customized on an individual basis. Learn more about teamspaces →
 To share a teamspace with groups in your workspace:
 Hover over the name of the teamspace in your sidebar.

Chunk 1901:
Click the
•

• button, then Teamspace settings.
 From here, you'll be able to search and add groups to the teamspace.
FAQs
 Is there a limit to how many guests I can add?
 See the guest limit for your plan here →
 If your workspace is above the guest limit for your plan, new users that you share content with can only be added as a member (instead of as a guest) if they belong to your workspace's email domains. This could mean that they have an allowed email domain or an email domain matching the workspace owner’s domain or one of the workspace’s verified domains.
 I clicked the Join or create workspace button, but it will only let me create a workspace. How do I join a workspace?

Chunk 1902:
You can only join a workspace via the Join or create workspace button if that workspace has the Allowed Email Domains setting enabled to allow users with your email domain join the workspace automatically.
 Otherwise, you'll need to ask an admin from the workspace to send you an invite.
 How do I share with individuals and not whole groups?
 You can share a private page with individual members of your workspace by clicking Share at the top right and then Invite a Person. Search for their name, set a level of access for them and press Invite.
 You can also share a private page with a guest through the same mechanism, only you should type their email instead of searching their name and press Invite.

Chunk 1903:
Why do I need to disable workspace-level access?
 You don't have to. Just know that whatever level of access is specified for Everyone at [workspace] is the lowest level of access for everyone in your workspace. If you want some pages to not be visible to certain people, then we recommend disabling it. You can always grant some groups or individuals more access.
 Why are these pages in the Shared section of my left-hand sidebar?
 Those are pages shared with only specific groups or individuals. They aren't visible to the rest of the people in your workspace. In order for pages shared with groups to show up in this part of your sidebar, you need to disable Everyone at [workspace]. Otherwise, everyone in your workspace will still see it.

Chunk 1904:
As a quick refresher, any page in the Workspace section of your sidebar can be viewed in some respect by everyone in your workspace. Any page in the Private section of your sidebar is for your eyes only.
 How can groups be used instead of multiple separate workspaces?
 We've seen people create multiple workspaces instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, and their executive team so these groups can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. There's a quick workaround for this using groups:
• Disable Workspace access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.

Chunk 1905:
• On every page, grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.
• So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top-level page for that team, turn on Full access for only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!

 Can I create a shared private page using groups?
 Yes. If you create a page in the Private section of your sidebar, you can go to Share and toggle on access for a group inside your workspace. Choose their access level like you would on any other page. You'll see the page automatically move to the Shared section of your sidebar. Only you and the members of that group will be able to see it.

Chunk 1907:
How can I allow members in my workspace to request guests for approval?
 As a workspace owner, you can disable guests for your workspace in your workspace security settings, but still allow members to send guest invite requests for review by the workspace owners. This provides a standardized way for guests to get access to content within your workspace, without being an all or nothing approach.

Lock pages and databases

Chunk 1913:
If you have a lot of people in the same workspace, it can be easy for accidental edits and changes to get made to a page or database. You can use Lock page or Lock database to prevent this without fully revoking edit rights from other members of your workspace.
Lock page
 For pages that contain non-database content, like documents, notes, wikis, etc., you can lock the content so that no one can make changes unless they explicitly turn the lock off — including you.
 Click
•
•
• at the top right corner of your page.
 Turn on Lock page in the menu that appears.
 Your page will immediately become read-only for everyone.

Chunk 1914:
• You can tell if a page is locked because a gray Locked indicator will appear next to the name of your page in the top breadcrumb menu.
 You can tell if a page is locked because a gray Locked indicator will appear next to the name of your page in the top breadcrumb menu.
 Note: Anyone with full or edit access to your page can turn page lock off using the same menu. It's designed to provide one layer of extra protection so people have to be intentional about the changes they make.
Lock views
 For full page databases, you can lock in structure while allowing other members of your workspace to continue editing the actual data.
 Click
•
•
• at the top right corner of the page.
 Switch on the toggle next to Lock database in the menu that appears.

Immediately, everyone on the page (including you) will only be able to edit the data the database contains, but not views or properties.
 Turn Lock database off using the same toggle in the

• menu.
 When a database is locked, you'll see Locked next to its title in the top breadcrumb menu.

Reminders
 When you add a reminder, Notion will send you a notification to draw your attention back to a particular task, event, or page at the time you specify. This is helpful for setting due dates and making sure you never forget a thing.

Chunk 1948:
Inline on a page, type @remind followed by a time, date, or both, i.e. @remind tomorrow, @remind 7pm, or @remind Wednesday at 1pm. This will create a blue tag.
 Clicking this tag opens up a calendar window where you can edit the date and time, change your timezone, and set exactly how you want to be reminded (i.e. 30 minutes beforehand).
 Inline reminders turn red when they change to @Today or are past due.
• In a database, add a Date property. When you click on that property (like on a cell in that column of a table), a calendar window opens where you can select when and how you want to be reminded. You can add a specific time of day as well.

Chunk 1949:
In a database, add a Date property. When you click on that property (like on a cell in that column of a table), a calendar window opens where you can select when and how you want to be reminded. You can add a specific time of day as well.
 When you set a reminder, you'll be notified at the chosen time in a few ways:
• You'll see a red badge pop up next to Inbox at the top of your left sidebar.
• If you have the desktop Notion app, you'll receive a push notification immediately.
• If you have the mobile Notion app, you'll receive a push notification within 5 minutes.
• If Notion isn't open at the time of your reminder, you'll get a mobile push notification (if you have the app) and an email.

Chunk 1950:
You'll see a red badge pop up next to Inbox at the top of your left sidebar.
 If you have the desktop Notion app, you'll receive a push notification immediately.
 If you have the mobile Notion app, you'll receive a push notification within 5 minutes.
 If Notion isn't open at the time of your reminder, you'll get a mobile push notification (if you have the app) and an email.
FAQs
 Someone @-mentioned me in a page, but I didn't receive an email notification.
 If you have Notion open on a mobile device or computer, you won't receive push or email notifications for reminders, you'll only get a red badge notification in All Updates.

Chunk 1951:
If Notion is not open on your mobile device or computer at the time of the notification, then you'll receive an email instead of a notification in All Updates.
 What's the difference between @-mentioning a page, and adding a Link to page block?
 Link to page works kind of like creating a sub-page. When you reference a Notion page this way, it will show up in your sidebar as a subpage of the page where it was linked.
 @-mentioning a page creates something more like a hyperlink. Pages you @-mention won’t show up as subpages of the pages they’ve been mentioned in.
 How can I trigger a reminder for someone else on my team?
 The best way to do this is to use an @-mention and @-remind on the same line. For example:

Chunk 1952:
"@Camille Ricketts @remind next Thursday 4pm to finish proofreading."
 Does Notion have recurring reminders? Like "remind me every Monday to water the plants"?
 Not at the moment, but recurring tasks and recurring reminders are on the roadmap!

FAQs

Chunk 2019:
Which versions of Confluence are supported?
 We officially support importing from Confluence Cloud, in pages created using the new editor that Confluence introduced in late 2018.
 Due to insufficient data in its index export, we do not support importing from Confluence Server.
 For help importing an entire workspace from the legacy editor, please contact support at team@makenotion.com.
 Do imported blocks count towards the storage limit for Free Plan workspaces with multiple members?
 No, imported blocks will not count towards the limit. However, any blocks subsequently created inside imported pages will count towards the limit as usual.
 Is there a maximum import size for Confluence imports?

Chunk 2020:
Confluence imports are limited to 5GB for zip-file imports and 30 GB for API imports.
 If you run into the limit, you can try using the Custom Export option to select pages for export, omitting attachment-heavy pages.
 When I try to import from Confluence, I can't choose my file in the file upload window.
 Please make sure to upload a .zip file created by the Confluence space export functionality. Word documents and standalone HTML files will not work, since Notion relies on the whole import to preserve structure and links between pages.
 I can't find the option to export my Confluence workspace.

Chunk 2021:
If the "Export" tab does not appear in the Content Tools section of a workspace's settings, you may not have the appropriate permissions to export pages. Ask the workspace administrator for permission.
 I can't seem to import from Evernote China/Evernote Business.
 Unfortunately, our importer only supports the standard edition of Evernote at the moment. We're working on it!

 If you're a member of an Enterprise plan workspace, exports might be disabled for your workspace. Workspace owners can turn off this option in the Security & identity tab of your Settings to keep workspace data internal.

Chunk 2044:
If you're a guest of the workspace, you need to have full access to see and use the export option.
 Why don't I see my export downloading right away?
 If a file is very large (depending on the number of sub-pages included), we may send you an email with a download link rather than automatically starting a download. This is not always the case. No email will be sent if you were able to download the file right away.

Export your entire workspace
 Note: You must be a workspace admin to do this.
 Your Notion data will always be backed up in the cloud, but you can also export it for safekeeping. You can export all your pages as HTML, Markdown, or CSV (for databases), along with any files you've uploaded, too.

Chunk 2049:
If you're on a Business or Enterprise Plan, you can also export your entire workspace to PDF, which can be helpful for legal and compliance backups.
 Pages that the exporter doesn't have access to, such as private pages of other users, will not be included in the export. Workspace admins on the Enterprise Plan can give themselves and others access to specific pages using content search, so that those pages can be included in future exports. Some content also may not be exported based on teamspace settings.
 A sitemap (index.html) is included the export to help you navigate the exported workspace. The list items in the sitemap are locally linked to the exported pages in HTML and Markdown formats.
 To export your workspace content:

Chunk 2050:
Go to Settings & members in your sidebar → Settings.
 Find and select Export all workspace content.
 You'll receive an email from Notion with a link to download your files. This link will expire after 7 days.
 Note:
• You can only export your entire workspace on desktop or web.
• You can’t instantly recreate your workspace by reuploading your exported workspace content.
 You can only export your entire workspace on desktop or web.
 You can’t instantly recreate your workspace by reuploading your exported workspace content.
Restore from trash
 Note: By default, pages will remain in Trash for 30 days before they are automatically removed from Trash. Enterprise plan workspace owners may customize these settings. Learn more here →

Chunk 2051:
To restore pages, go to Trash, find the page you're looking for, and click on the curved arrow icon next to it. Your page will return to where it was last in your workspace.
Restore from edit history
 You can view and restore past versions of any Notion page going back several days, depending on what plan you're on. Learn more about edit history here →
Accidental deletions
 Accidents happen! If you accidentally delete a page, a workspace, or even your entire account, we can help. We keep backups of our database, which allows us to restore a snapshot of any page in the past 30 days if you need it.
 Send us a message in Notion by clicking ? at the bottom right on desktop (or in your sidebar on mobile), or email us at team@makenotion.com.

FAQs
 I tried clicking the Export all workspace content button but received an error message.
 Oof, so sorry about this 😓 For particularly large workspaces, the Export all workspace content function may have some trouble completing the export. We're investigating this issue and hope to have a resolution soon.
 As a temporary workaround for this issue, you can export in smaller batches:
 Navigate to a top-level page in your workspace
 Click the
•
•
• button at the top right of the page, then click Export (you may not see this option if you're not an admin in the workspace)
 Choose Markdown & CSV or HTML as the export format, and turn on the Include subpages toggle

Chunk 2053:
Repeat for any other important top-level pages in the workspace that you'd like to have a backup of
 Please note that we keep per-minute backups on our servers, and can help with data recovery at any time at team@makenotion.com. Thanks for your patience while we work on fixing this issue!
 Is there a way to schedule automatic backups?
 Not at the moment, but we're continuing to update our API, which may help to enable automatic backups in the future through integrations ⚙️ Learn more about our API here →
 How can I migrate all my Notion content to a different account?
 Note: Any migrated content will be duplicated to the new workspace and these pages sometimes have issues. For more information, click here.

Chunk 2054:
Log into the account that has the workspace.
 Consolidate all of your pages under one top-level page there.
 Share this page with full access to the email address of the destination account.
 Log into the destination account and navigate to the workspace switcher.
 Access that shared top-level page.
 Select all the sub-pages, click the ⋮⋮ icon and select Move To. (Note: you can only move sub-pages, you will not be able to move the top-level page.)
 Select the destination workspace.
 Voila! Your content has a new home ✨
 How can I empty my trash?
 There isn’t a way to empty your trash all at once. You can go in and delete individual pages from the trash — otherwise, pages in the trash will be automatically and permanently deleted after 30 days.

Chunk 2055:
Enterprise plan workspace owners may customize these settings. Learn more here →

Embeds in Notion

Chunk 2060:
Notion allows you to embed external content from over 1,900 domains via the Iframely service. This enables you to bring videos, screencasts, slide decks, images, audio, code repositories, and more into your Notion pages, so that you can keep all context in one place. As needed to display embedded content, Iframely and the embedded app may receive the IP address of the content's viewers.
 Here is a selection of some of the commonly used apps that you can embed into your Notion pages:
 Abstract
 Canva
 Code Pen
 Excalidraw
 Facebook
 Flocus
 Framer
 Indify
 Instagram
 Invision
 Git Hub Gist
 GIPHY
 Google Maps
 Linked In
 Loom
 Miro
 Mixpanel
 Pinterest
 Reddit
 Replit
 Sketch
 Streamlit
 Slideshare
 Spotify
 Tableau
 Tally
 Tik Tok
 Twitter
 Typeform
 Vimeo
 Widgetbox
 You Tube

Chunk 2061:
While pretty much any online content can be embedded on a page, Notion also has preconfigured embed blocks for some of the commonly used media types (e.g., File, Image, PDF, Video) and apps (Code Pen, Loom, Miro, Tweet).
 These can be added specifically from the / menu or by clicking + in the left margin that appears when you hover over a new line. Try it out by typing /tweet to embed a Tweet, or /maps to embed an interactive Google Map.
 Note: Embeds that require login to an external site will not work on Notion's desktop app or mobile apps.
Supported file types
 In Notion, you can embed:
• PDF files
• Audio
• Images
 HTML files
 PDF files

 In the menu that appears, select Paste as bookmark.
Resize and arrange embeds
 Most embeds can be resized to suit their content and the format of your page.
• Hover your mouse over your embed, then drag the black bars that appear on the sides.
• Use drag-and-drop to move embeds around your page. Hover over the embed in question, then use the ⋮⋮ icon that appears as a handle to drag it.

•
•
• at its top right. Choose Replace.
 When prompted, choose Embed link or Upload.
 Paste the new URL from the online service, or select the new file.
 Note: If the source of your embed changes in any way, that change will appear in Notion too.
Web bookmarks
 Bookmarks are one way to incorporate web links into your Notion page. They appear like distinct blocks with the page title, description and URL displayed.
 Copy and paste the URL.

Chunk 2065:
In the menu that appears, select Paste as bookmark.
Link mentions
 Link mentions are another way to incorporate links into your Notion page. They appear inline, similar to text, and are more subtle than bookmarks.

 You can connect multiple Google accounts to embed files from multiple Google Drives.
Embed a Google Calendar
 You can embed a view-only Google Calendar into Notion if the Gmail address you use for your calendar is the same one you use for Notion.

Chunk 2068:
Under My calendars, click on the ⋮ next to the calendar you'd like to embed and choose Settings and sharing.
 Under Access permissions check Make available to public with See all event details selected.

• Pasting a link as a mention

Chunk 2098:
Link previews allow you to see live, synced visualizations of links directly in Notion. This is currently supported for several platforms:
 Git Hub
 Jira
 Slack
 Asana
 Trello
 Linear
 Zoom
 Figma
 Adobe XD
 Dropbox
 One Drive & Sharepoint
 Pitch
 Amplitude
 Hex
 GRID
 Git Lab
 Box
 Lucid (Lucidspark and Lucidchart)
 Whimsical
 Click Up
 Zendesk
Pasting a link as a preview
 Copy a link from any of the supported platforms. Paste it into Notion and select Paste as: Preview.
 The first time that you paste a link from one of these platforms, you'll see a button that asks you to connect to the app.
 Once you click the button to connect, you'll be redirected to a browser window. Here, the app will ask for authentication and permission to display content in Notion.

Chunk 2099:
When you've authenticated with the app, you'll see a detailed preview of the linked content. This preview updates as changes are made to any relevant fields.
 Note: Once you've authenticated a connected app, anyone who can view your Notion page will be able to see corresponding content that you've pasted as a link preview.
 In some cases, information will be abstracted (e.g., channel names from Slack private channels and DMs).
Pasting a link as a mention
 In addition to previews, you can also paste links from these platforms as mentions. These provide a more condensed visualization of the content in the link.
 Copy a link from any of the supported platforms. Paste it into Notion and you'll see the option to Paste as: Mention.

Chunk 2100:
Similarly to previews, you'll have to authenticate the app the very first time you paste a corresponding link in Notion. Click the button to open the authentication window and grant the necessary permissions. Afterward, you'll see the link mention pop up!
 Tip: You can paste links as mentions directly inline, next to other text!
FAQs
 I’m receiving an “Access denied” or “Content not found” error in my link preview.
 There are two possible reasons for this:
 You may not have authenticated with the account that has access. You can connect multiple accounts either through Settings & Members → My connections, or the error drop down.

Chunk 2101:
Your organization may have limited access to content via 3rd party integrations or IP addresses. Please confirm with your workspace or organization administrator and ask to have Notion’s integration approved if this is the case. Here are instructions for specific integrations: Git Hub, Jira, Slack, Asana, Trello.
 Can I add more than one login for a link preview integration?
 You can! You can do so via Settings & Members → My connections. For the desired integration, select “Connect another account”.
 Note: Some applications do not support multi-account login in the browser (e.g. Git Hub), so you might need to logout of whichever account is currently logged in on your browser to be prompted to login with a different account.

Chunk 2102:
We’ll determine which of your accounts to use to preview given resources and show an error if none of them are successful.
 I’m receiving a general  “Can’t load preview” error in my link preview.
 Run through these steps to try to resolve.
 Confirm you’ve authenticated with the correct account for the resource.
 Confirm no access restrictions for your organization.
 Delete your integration in Notion via the My connection settings. You may also want to revoke the integration the corresponding platform: Git Hub, Jira, Slack, Asana,   Trello.
 Try to unfurl again.

Chunk 2103:
Finally, if all else fails, reach out to support! Unfortunately, we cannot help resolve errors related to Access denied or Content not found. Please provide the following information when reaching out to support:
• Integration you’re trying to use
• URL you’re trying to preview (if possible)
 Integration you’re trying to use

• Adding a new property to a synced database

Chunk 2107:
• People properties in synced databases
 Synced databases allow you to sync data from other platforms as Notion databases. Syncs are continuous but only go one direction, meaning that data changes will need to happen on the original platform in order for updates to appear in Notion.
 Platforms include:
• Git Hub PRs and issues
• Asana projects and tasks
• Git Lab merge requests and issues
 Jira boards and projects
 Git Hub PRs and issues
 Asana projects and tasks
 Git Lab merge requests and issues
 More apps will be supported in the future!

Asana
 To create a synced database for Asana:
 In Asana, open your project and copy the project link. Make sure you're not just copying the link in your browser's URL bar.
 Paste the link into Notion and select Paste as database.
• If you haven't already, you will be prompted to sign in and connect Notion with your Asana account.
 If you haven't already, you will be prompted to sign in and connect Notion with your Asana account.

Chunk 2109:
The synced database will created in a table view, with all Asana properties automatically added.
 The database will begin populating automatically and will continue to sync if you navigate away from the page.
 Note: Synced databases only go in one direction, meaning that changes will need to happen in the source (Jira, Git Hub, Asana) in order for updates to reflect in Notion.
Adding a new property to a synced database
 You can add any Notion property to a synced database. There are two things to know when adding an additional Notion property onto a synced database.

Chunk 2110:
• If a property is deleted on the third-party app (i.e. you delete a task in Jira), the associated synced database row and all properties will be deleted. They will be accessible in the trash to view what was deleted, but cannot be restored.
• If an added Notion property shares a name with any third-party properties (Jira, Git Hub, Git Lab, or Asana), that property will not sync.
 If a property is deleted on the third-party app (i.e. you delete a task in Jira), the associated synced database row and all properties will be deleted. They will be accessible in the trash to view what was deleted, but cannot be restored.

Chunk 2111:
If an added Notion property shares a name with any third-party properties (Jira, Git Hub, Git Lab, or Asana), that property will not sync.
People properties in synced databases
 Synced databases will include people properties! Now, you can use identity mapping to connect third party Git Hub and JIRA identities to your team's Notion profiles.

Easily import all of your Asana projects and tasks directly into Notion 📥
• How importing from Asana works
• How Asana maps to Notion
• Tasks database
• Import logs

Chunk 2121:
Importing from Asana allows you to move your organization’s teams, projects, and tasks in Asana into Notion. Any member on any plan can take advantage of the Asana importer.
 Importing from Asana vs. syncing Asana with Notion
 Importing your Asana data into Notion is best if you want to move from Asana and use Notion as the primary tool for your work. The data will be duplicated into Notion, but not synchronized with Asana.
 Synced databases allow you to connect Asana to Notion without importing any data. You might prefer to use synced databases if you use both Asana and Notion for your work. Synced databases only go one direction, meaning that changes will need to happen in Asana in order for updates to reflect in Notion.

Chunk 2122:
To add a synced database from Asana, simply paste a project link right into a Notion page. Learn more about synced databases here →

 Your Asana projects will be imported into a Projects database in Notion. The Asana importer will pre-populate default database views for ease of use. You can add or delete views and properties as needed.
 These default database views include:
• Active (table view): This view shows the projects you’ve imported whose status is to-do or in progress. In other words, this view doesn’t show projects that have already been completed. There are also preset filters for owner and date to make searching easier.

Chunk 2128:
• Timeline view: This view displays project name, status, owner, and completion rate. There are also preset filters for status, owner, and date to make searching easier.
• Board view: This view shows your projects grouped by status (Planning, Backlog, On Track). You can customize the statuses that show in the view in the
•
•
• menu. Projects are sorted by descending priority.
• All (table view): This view displays all of your imported projects. There are preset filters for status, owner, and date to make searching easier.

Import logs
 When your import completes, you will receive an import log in the private section of your sidebar. In this log you will find a summary of your import, including the Notion teamspace that your Asana projects and tasks were imported into.
FAQs

Chunk 2135:
How are the Task assignees imported if that assignee is not present in Notion?
 If the Tasks assignees imported do not have a Notion, the user would be added as a placeholder to the workspace.
 These placeholder accounts will attribute comments and mentions. If and when these users sign up, they will be mapped to the corresponding placeholder account, and comments and mentions will be attributed to the correct user.
 How long does it take for the Asana Importer tool to import a large number of tasks?
 Import times may range from a few minutes to several hours depending up on the size of the import. You will receive an email notification once the import is complete.
 Is there a limit to the number of tasks that can be imported at once?

Chunk 2136:
There are no hard limits on number of tasks that can be imported, but we recommend limiting imports to 20K tasks per teamspace.
 How are subtasks imported?
 They are imported as subtasks (along with dependencies) that are within the same  database.
 Do updates I make in my Asana account automatically get updated in Notion?
 No, the import is a one-time action.
 We do not maintain a connection with your Asana account and any changes you make in your Asana account after the import will not automatically update in Notion.
 Is there a way to preview the import before they are added? Can I undo an import?
 There is no way to preview or undo, but during the process you will select which specific projects you wish to import.

Chunk 2137:
In addition you can easily delete specific projects or tasks within Notion. You can even delete the entire database and start over.

Chunk 2140:
• Import
 It's important to have all your data in one spot. Here's a helpful tutorial for importing your Confluence space into Notion.
 Depending on your needs, there are two ways you can import from Confluence into Notion.
 Zip-file importer
• Can only import smaller workspaces of up to 5GB (or 15GB upon request)
 Can be used to import only part of your workspace if you prefer
 Can only import smaller workspaces of up to 5GB (or 15GB upon request)

 Retains comments and user-mapping
Import with .zip files
Export your Confluence space to HTML
 From your Confluence workspace, go to Space Settings in the top-right sidebar.
 Select Content Tools in the top toolbar, then Export in the toolbar below. If you don't see either of these options, you may need to request permission to export from a Workspace admin.
 Select HTML from the list of formats.
 Select Custom Export and uncheck the Include comments box.
 Select which pages you want to export — please note that pages containing large attachments can significantly increase the export size and complexity!
 Allow your export to finish processing — this can take a while if you have a large workspace.

Chunk 2142:
Once the export is complete, click Download here to save the export to your computer.
 You should have a file titled something like Confluence-space-export-XXXXXX.html.zip, where XXXXXX is a sequence of digits.
Import
 Start by navigating to the Notion workspace that you'd like to import your Confluence content into.
 Go to Settings & members in your sidebar → Import → Confluence.
 Navigate to the .zip file exported from Confluence in the previous step, and select it for upload. You do not need to unzip the file! Just upload the entire archive.
 You should see an "Uploading..." message as the browser uploads your file, then a status message as the import progresses.

Chunk 2143:
When your import completes, it should take you to your newly imported content!
Import with Confluence API
Connect Confluence and Notion
 Go to Settings & members in your sidebar → Import → Confluence.
 Choose Import via API.
 For authentication, select your Confluence instance type: cloud or server. To find your instance type, open Confluence, click Help → ? next your profile → About Confluence. This tells you if your instance is cloud, server, or datacenter. Notion only supports cloud and server instances.
Authenticate with Confluence Cloud
 Enter your Confluence email and site.
 Create an API token from your Atlassian account and enter it into the field. Read more about creating tokens in Confluence.
 Click Authenticate.

Chunk 2144:
Authenticate with Confluence Server
 Find and select your Confluence version.
 Enter your Confluence email and site.
 If you're running Confluence 7.9 or later, create a Personal Access Token and paste it. If you're using a version prior to Confluence 7.9, enter your Confluence username and password.
 Click Authenticate.
Import
 To begin importing, click on Confluence from the Import menu.
 On the following screen, you can monitor the progress of your import. This step may take several hours, depending on the size of the space.
• Once you see the message Importing pages…, you can safely close your browser window. We will send you an email once the import is complete.

Chunk 2145:
Once you see the message Importing pages…, you can safely close your browser window. We will send you an email once the import is complete.
 Repeat this section if you want to import more than one Confluence space.
 Note: When you import into Notion using Confluence API, page permissions are also carried over. For the best experience, make sure:
• All users and user groups from your Confluence workspace are set up in Notion.

Easily import your data from Monday into Notion 📥

• Limitations
• Import from Monday.com into Notion

Chunk 2149:
The Monday.com importer helps you bring your Monday.com boards and all the data within them into Notion.
 Note: At this time, our Monday.com importer only supports Projects and Tasks type boards. Check or change your board type in Monday.com by following the instructions to customize item terminology in this article.
How importing from Monday.com works
How Monday.com maps to Notion
• If you import a task board and related projects, we’ll import the tasks into the task database and create a project in the project database using the task board’s name.
• If you import a task board without any related projects, we’ll important the tasks into the task database and create a project in the project database using the task board’s name.

Chunk 2150:
• Every teamspace in Notion gets one project and one task database per import, so if you have multiple projects within one teamspace, all of those projects will go into the same database, unless imported in batches. As a workaround, you can import any additional projects into a separate teamspace and move them manually afterwards, or import your account in batches so that you can bring more projects and task databases to the same teamspaces each time.
• The importer will also import all information about task owners and due dates into your Notion database.

Chunk 2151:
• Note that an assignee in Monday.com must be named Owner, Assignee, or Person in order for that information to properly appear in Notion as an assignee. Any project or task board should only have one column to indicate an assignee.

Import duration and size
• Imports can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours depending on size. You’ll receive an email notification once your import is complete.
• There’s no limit to how many tasks you can import, but for the best experience, we recommend importing 10,000 tasks per teamspace, per import.

• The importer won’t import documents. Instead, we’ll display the corresponding Monday.com document link in Notion.
• You can import tasks from multiple workspaces, but you’re limited to importing one workspace at a time.
• The import is a one-time event; any future changes you make in Monday.com won’t automatically reflect in Notion.

Connect Notion and Git Hub so you can keep your workflows in sync 🧮
• Create Git Hub code previews
• Create a synced database
• People properties
• Link Git Hub PRs to Notion

Chunk 2159:
• Use magic words to link Git Hub PRs to Notion tasks
• Disconnect Git Hub from Notion
 Notion's integration with Git Hub allows you to seamlessly connect your development workflows. You can link Git Hub content directly in Notion pages, pull Git Hub information into Notion databases, and sync pull requests with Notion tasks to keep your team informed of project statuses. Read on to learn about the different features of the integration and how you can set them up.
Set up Git Hub integration
 Note: You can only connect one Notion workspace to a Git Hub organization. If you’d like to connect a different Notion workspace to your Git Hub organization, you’ll first have to disconnect your current Notion workspace.

Chunk 2160:
You will need to be both a Notion workspace owner and a Git Hub org admin to connect Notion and the Git Hub workspace app.
 Go to Settings in the sidebar.
 Click on My connections and find Git Hub (Workspace).
 Click Connect and go through the authentication flow.
Create Git Hub code previews
 Link to a file or specific lines from a file directly in Notion. You can even link from a specific commit or branch if you want the code you’re referencing to be up-to-date.
 Copy the permalink for your desired lines from Git Hub.
 Paste it into a Notion page and select Paste as preview to embed the code into your page.
Create a synced database
 You can sync your Git Hub repositories (including pull requests and issues) into Notion as databases. To do this:

Chunk 2161:
In Git Hub, copy the link to a PR or issue.
 Paste the link into Notion and select Paste as database.
• If you haven't already, you will be prompted to sign in and connect Notion with your Git Hub account.
 If you haven't already, you will be prompted to sign in and connect Notion with your Git Hub account.
 The synced database will be created in a table view, with all Git Hub properties automatically added.
 The database will begin populating automatically and will continue to sync if you navigate away from the page.
Supported Git Hub properties
 Here is a list of Git Hub properties that we support:
 Title
 Assignees
 Description
 State
 PR or Issue number
 Creator
 Created time
 Merged, updated, and closed time
 Reviewers

Chunk 2162:
Labels and tags aren’t supported at this time.
People properties
 You can use identity mapping to connect Git Hub identities to your team's Notion profiles. To do this:
 Navigate to your Git Hub email settings and ensure that the Keep my email addresses private setting is not checked on.
 In your Git Hub profile (https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME_HERE}), edit your profile to add your Notion email address.
 This enables your identity to be mapped to synced databases in workspaces you are a member of.
Link Git Hub PRs to Notion
 To link PRs from Git Hub to a Notion, you'll need a prefixed unique ID property in your database.
 Learn more about unique IDs here!

Chunk 2163:
The Git Hub Pull Request property inside your Notion database will automatically keep your cross-functional teams informed of task statuses. It also has many attributes that you can use in rollups, formulas, and filters.
 In a Notion database, click + to add a new property.
 Search for and click Git Hub Pull Requests to add this property to your database.
 Make sure your database has a Unique ID property. This property will be added to your database if it doesn’t already have one.
 To use the Git Hub Pull Request property, make sure you’ve connected your Git Hub account with Notion. Then, either add the Unique ID of the Notion task to the pull request, or paste the Git Hub pull request URL into the property.

Chunk 2164:
By default, Notion enables backlinks on Notion tasks to Git Hub. If you want to turn this off, click on the Git Hub Pull Request property in your database → Edit property. Toggle off Linkbacks in Git Hub.
Automate task status updates
 You can use the Git Hub Pull Requests property to automatically update the status of your tasks in Notion.
 Select the title of your Git Hub Pull Requests property and click Edit property.
 Find the Auto-update section and select the status property you want to update from the drop down menu.
 Select the task status to be set when the Git Hub PR is Opened, Review Requested, Approved, and Merged.
 Now when the PR progresses in Git Hub, your task status in Notion will be updated automatically based on your settings.

Chunk 2165:
You can also show Git Hub activity in the linked Notion task. To do this, click on the Git Hub property in your database → Edit property. Turn on Activity Comments.
Use magic words to link Git Hub PRs to Notion tasks
 If you want to link a Git Hub PR to one or more Notion tasks, simply enter a magic word and the Notion tasks’ unique ID in your PR’s description.
 Magic words are key words that help establish relationships between Notion tasks and Git Hub PRs. You can use any of the following words:
• close, closes, closed
• fix, fixes, fixed
• resolve, resolves, resolved
• complete, completes, completed, completing
• ref, references
• related to
• contributes to
• towards
 close, closes, closed
 fix, fixes, fixed

Chunk 2166:
resolve, resolves, resolved
 complete, completes, completed, completing
 ref, references
 part of
 related to
 contributes to
 towards
 For example, your PR could have the description “fixes CTT-13”. Once that description is set, your Notion task with the ID CTT-13 will be linked with that PR.
 If your PR description uses magic words associated with closing or finishing a task, the Notion task will be marked as done when the PR is merged.
 If your PR description uses magic words associated with referring to or relating to a task, the Notion task will not be marked as done when the PR is merged.
 You can link Notion tasks as reference-only, so that those tasks won’t be marked as done.
Disconnect Git Hub from Notion

Chunk 2167:
To disconnect Git Hub from Notion, you’ll need to be a Notion workspace owner.
 Go to Settings.
 Select Connections.
 Next to Git Hub, select
•
•
• → Disconnect all users.
 When you disconnect Git Hub from Notion, nobody in your workspace will be able to use the integration until it’s set up again.

FAQs
 Can I choose to use just one part of the integration?
 Unfortunately, this is not possible today. When you install Notion’s Slack integration you’ll have the full functionality/all features of the Slack integration.
 However, since only users with edit access to a page can set up Notion notifications to Slack, you can control parts of the integration by restricting permissions.
 What permission level is required to create a database notification?
 A user needs Full Access to a Notion database to be able to set up database notifications.

Chunk 2183:
Anyone with at least View access to a database can see all the existing Slack notifications that have been set up. However, they can’t edit or create any themselves.
 How do permissions work when I share a Notion page in a Slack channel?
 The user that shares the page will get a prompt informing them some people in the channel don't have access to the doc. The user is then able to decide if they want to share the page with the people that don't have access. They also have the option to delete the page preview in Slack.
 Can admins control who can connect Slack to a Notion workspace?

Chunk 2184:
As an admin in Slack you can manage settings that give you approval rights for any Slack integration. The same settings will apply to Notion if you choose to turn them on.
 On Enterprise plans, Notion admins can also restrict members from installing the Slack integration using their admin permissions to manage connections.
 Where can you view and manage the Slack notifications you've set up in your Notion workspace?
 Database notifications can be managed and edited in the the individual database they’ve been created in. There is currently no way to see all database notification workflows in your workspace from one central place.
 Personal @-mention notifications can be managed from Settings and members → My notifications & settings

Chunk 2185:
When one person connects Notion to Slack, does that turn it on for everyone?
 No, when one user sets up the integration all Slack users will be able to see an unfurled Notion page link or a Slack link preview in Notion.
 But to use the functionality themselves, other users have to connect Slack individually.
 How do I send Slack messages to a specific database view?
 The easiest way to send a Slack message to a specific database view (e.g. you might have a view for only your team’s tasks), is to copy the link to the database view and paste that link into the send to Notion prompt in Slack.
 When you send a Slack message to a specific database view, the properties are auto-filled for you. No need to update them yourself manually!

Chunk 2186:
Does the @-mentioned notification in Slack work when a user is mentioned as part of a group @-mention in Notion?
 Yes. A group mention in Notion will trigger the @mention notification in Slack to all members of the Notion group that have the Slack @mention turned on.
 Are there other 3rd party integrations providers and can I continue to use them (e.g. Zapier)?
 Yes those integrations will continue to work as before
 Will this new integration impact how I currently use Slack link previews?
 Slack link previews will continue to exist and work normally.
 If you'd like to use the new features (send messages to Notion, notifications in Slack, and expandable links) you'll need to re-install the Slack integration here

Chunk 2195:
Synced databases work with Jira Cloud products (Jira Software, Jira Product Discovery, Jira Work Management, and Jira Service Management), with support for Jira Server coming soon!
 Jira Sync displays your Jira projects and issues as Notion projects and issues databases. This setup allows you to see and track multiple projects using a variety of helpful views, filters, and sorts.
 You can even use identity mapping to connect Jira identities to Notion profiles so that you can see who’s responsible for what in synced Notion databases.
 🟡 Note: Only workspace owners can set up Jira Sync, by using a Jira Admin token. After that, any member can utilize the connection.
Set up Jira Sync

Chunk 2196:
Although any member can create syncs, you'll need to be a workspace owner to set up Jira Sync initially.

 Repeat the steps above if you’d like to set up another Jira sync for another site, teamspace, or workspace. Comments and attachments (up to five files per issue, no larger than 1MB) will also be synced.
 You can apply permissions to the database page to make the synced databases accessible to your collaborators.
 Note: Jira synced databases will inherit Notion permissions. Members can access synced databases on any pages they have permission to view.

Chunk 2199:
If a member adds a private Jira project to a Notion page, anyone with Notion page access will see it.
People property in your synced database
 Synced databases will include people properties! Now, you can use identity mapping to connect third party JIRA identities to your team's Notion profiles. To do this:
 Confirm you have implemented Jira Cloud.
 If you’re an admin, go to Jira, click on Jira System settings, and change the user email visibility from Hidden to Public inside your organization. If you're an individual user, you’ll need to manually change their settings by changing the email visibility option. Follow the instructions here →

How Jira Sync works
Projects database
 Your Jira projects will be synced into a Notion projects database. Your projects will be intelligently mapped to their corresponding Jira issues in a related, synced issues database in Notion. This database will come with pre-populated default database views to help you get started more quickly:

Chunk 2201:
• Active (table view): This view shows the projects you’ve synced whose status is in progress. In other words, this view doesn’t show projects that have already been completed. There are also preset filters for owner and date to make searching easier.
• Timeline view: This view displays project name, status, owner, and completion rate. There are also preset filters for status, owner, and date to make searching easier.
• Board view: This view shows your projects grouped by status (Planning, In Progress). You can customize the statuses that show in the view in the
•
•
• menu. Projects are sorted by descending priority.

Chunk 2202:
• All (table view): This view displays all of your synced projects. There are preset filters for status, owner, and date to make searching easier.

 All (table view): This view displays all of your synced projects. There are preset filters for status, owner, and date to make searching easier.
Issues database
 Your Jira issues (epic, bug, task, subtask, story) will be synced into a Notion issues database, the equivalent of a Notion tasks database. As with the synced projects database, there will be default database views created for you to help you get started more quickly:

Chunk 2204:
• By Project (table view): This view shows all tasks, grouped by project. There are pre-set filters for status, assignee, date, and project to make searching easier.
• By Epic (table view): This view shows your Jira stories, tasks, and bugs grouped by Epic.
• Board view: This view is grouped by status and sorted by descending priority. The pre-set properties that will be displayed are assignee, project, priority, and sub-tasks,
• All tasks (table view): This view displays all your synced tasks. The pre-set properties that will be displayed are task name, status, assignee, date, priority, tags, and project

Chunk 2205:
• Mine (table view): This view is filtered to only show tasks that are assigned to you. There are pre-set filters for status, date, and project.

Unsupported Jira properties
 Jira Sync supports most Jira properties, but not all of them. Here's the list of unsupported Jira properties:
 Time tracking
 Resolution
 Security level
 Σ progress
 Progress
 Restrict to
 Status Category
 Rank
 While Notion doesn't support certain Jira custom properties, it does support all Jira primitive custom properties, such as string, number, select, person, and date.
Sync duration and limitations
• It should only take a few minutes for the initial sync to complete, but depending on the size of your Jira projects and issues, this could take up to a few hours.

Chunk 2207:
• Some issue fields or properties may not sync, such as rich text in property and nested multi-selects.
• Once the initial sync has been set up, updates to properties should be reflected in Notion in real time. If you create new properties, it could take up to 12 hours for those changes to sync.
• You can’t manually sync Jira with Notion — syncs happen in response to updates made in Jira.
• At this time, updates from Jira will sync to your Notion database in real time — not the other way around. Any changes you make in your Notion database won’t sync to Jira.

Chunk 2208:
• You’ll be able to see when Notion last Synced with Jira with Notion, in a blue badge at the very top of a database. If instead you see a yellow Sync failed or Sync stopped, you may have to follow the steps below to reconnect Jira.
• Make sure you have edit access or full access to a synced database if you want to add or remove projects or properties.
• If you’re not seeing updates on the Notion side, try refreshing the page.
• The Watcher property can take up to 12 hours to sync properly.

 Make sure you have edit access or full access to a synced database if you want to add or remove projects or properties.
 If you’re not seeing updates on the Notion side, try refreshing the page.
 The Watcher property can take up to 12 hours to sync properly.
 Note: If you delete a property in Jira, the associated database item in your synced database will be deleted too.
Reconnect your synced database

Chunk 2211:
If your webhook registration has failed, or your project sync has failed, you’ll see Sync failed at the top of the database. To solve this issue, try the sync again with a different set of projects. You can also ensure that your projects don’t have any issues in Jira.
 If your Jira token is no longer valid or someone has disconnected Jira from Notion, you’ll see Sync stopped at the top of the database. To solve this issue, select Re-authenticate next to Sync stopped. You must be a workspace owner to complete this process.
 Once your Jira instance is reconnected with Notion, your projects and issues databases won’t be recreated; instead, you’ll continue to use the projects and issues databases you had before.
Disconnect Jira

Chunk 2212:
If you want to completely disconnect Jira from Notion:
 Go to Settings in your sidebar → Import.
 Select select
•
•
• next to Jira → Remove.
Legacy synced databases
 Legacy synced databases look something like this. If you do have a legacy synced database, you can follow the steps above to recreate your projects and issues databases in Notion using the new and improved Jira Sync.

You can use Notion on your Mac or PC as a downloadable desktop application. Here's what you need to know 🖥️
• Why use the desktop app?
• Command Search
• Download the app
• Windows desktop app

Chunk 2221:
• System requirements
Why use the desktop app?
 Notion's desktop app is a clean, distraction-free interface without all the temptation of tabs. Switching between tabs in the desktop app is smooth and quick so that you can work more efficiently. You can even hover over a tab to preview the page inside it.
 You'll receive push notifications in the desktop app when something important happens inside Notion, like when someone mentions you, someone assigns you a task, or you set a reminder for yourself.
New Tab Search

Chunk 2222:
Navigating to a new page is quick and easy in the desktop app. With Notion for desktop, you can set every new tab you create to open up a search window. From the search window that opens when you open a new tab, you can:
• Look for and quickly navigate to the page you want.
• Open a new page or start a chat with Notion AI in a new tab in just one click.
• Jump to an existing tab.
 Look for and quickly navigate to the page you want.

 Go to Settings → My settings.

Chunk 2223:
Toggle off New Tab Search. If this setting is toggled off, new tabs will display the default page specified in the Open on start setting.
Command Search
 On desktop, you can use search and Q&A even when you’re outside of the Notion app. Trigger Command Search with a customizable keyboard shortcut, your menu bar on Mac, or your task bar on Windows so you can search or ask Q&A without switching between windows or bringing the Notion desktop app to the foreground. To make it easier to access Notion this way, a few things will happen by default:

Chunk 2224:
• Command Search will be turned on. To turn this off, go to Settings → My settings → toggle off Enable Command Search. You can also turn off Show Notion in Menu Bar or customize your Command Search shortcut.

Once you've downloaded and installed the Web Clipper, you'll see a small Notion button appear just to the right of your browser search bar.
Use the clipper
 Log into Notion on your browser with the account you want to clip into.
 Click the Notion icon to the right of your browser search bar.
 A small window will pop up asking which workspace and Notion page (or database) you want to add the web page into.
• You can create a new database to save your web pages into by clicking + New links database in the Add to menu. You can change the name of the page in the text box.
• If you'd like to clip into a page or database that already exists, it might not be included in the default list. You can search for it!

Chunk 2278:

 If you'd like to clip into a page or database that already exists, it might not be included in the default list. You can search for it!
 Press Save page or enter.
 You'll have the option to Open in Notion to go right to the page you just saved.
 When you clip a web page into a database, a URL property will automatically be added to capture the address of the original page (even if there wasn't one before)!
 You can also add tags, other properties, comments, and edits to the pages you clip. Here's what a clipped article looks like in a Notion database:
On mobile

Chunk 2279:
Our mobile Web Clipper uses native share sheet functionality on both i OS and Android.
 Note: You'll need i OS version 13.0 or above to use Web Clipper on i Phone or i Pad. For Android, you'll need version 7.0 or above.
Clip on i OS
 Open Safari or Chrome on your device and tap the Share icon on any page you want to save. (It looks like a box with an upward arrow in the center.)
 This will bring up your device's mobile share sheet. Scroll through the apps that appear to select
•
•
• More.
 From that menu, turn on Notion access.
 From now on, Notion will appear on your mobile share sheet.
 Tap the Notion icon, title the page you're saving, choose which workspace and page you want to add it to, and tap Save.

Chunk 2280:
Go to the page you chose to see your clipping, comment on it, add properties, etc.!
Clip on Android
 Notion will be added automatically to your browser's sharing options, no extra steps required!
 Open Chrome, and on any page you want to save, click the share icon.
 This will bring up the mobile share sheet, which will already include Notion.
 Tap the Notion icon, title the page you're saving, choose which workspace and page/database you want to add it to, and tap Save.
 Go to the page you chose to see your clipping, comment on it, add properties, etc.!
Clip images & local files on your phone
 Want to add the photos you take on your phone to your Notion workspace? You can do that in just a few steps:

Chunk 2281:
Select the photos you want to copy into Notion.
 Tap the Share icon at the bottom of your screen.
 Tap on Notion if it's already an option in the share menu that pops up. (Or, on i Phone, scroll to tap
•
•
• More and turn Notion on as an option.)
 Create a title for the image, select the Notion workspace you want, and tap Add to to choose the exact page/database you want to add the image to.
 When you clip local files to a database, no URL will be added.
 Note: Websites are built in all kinds of ways, so they can't all be parsed the same way. Formatting in Notion will vary. We've made sure clips from top sites like Pinterest, Netflix, Wikipedia, etc. look great, and we're always improving!
FAQs

Chunk 2282:
I tried using the web clipper on mobile, but got an error message This app is not supported.
 Unfortunately, Notion Web Clipper only works for entire pages from your web browser, or photos from your photo roll. It doesn't support other apps yet, like the Twitter app or the i OS Notes app. Definitely possible in the future though!
 I tried clipping a web page with the Web Clipper, but some of the page content is missing.
 Oops, sorry about that 🙈 If you wouldn't mind sharing the URL with us at team@makenotion.com, we'd be happy to flag to our engineering team so they can tweak the clipper accordingly.
 Can you add tags to a web page while clipping it?
 Not at the moment, unfortunately. Definitely possible for a future iteration though ✂️

Chunk 2283:
For the time being, you'll need to open the clipped page in a Notion database to add and edit any tags or other database properties.
 I installed the Safari extension, but am seeing long loading spinners when I try to use it.
 Unfortunately, some Safari configurations seem to be causing performance issues across many different Safari extensions, including Notion's. To help our engineering team debug this issue with Apple, could you let us know:
• What version of mac OS are you running on your computer?
• In the Safari → About Safari window, which version number of Safari are you running on your computer?
• In the Safari → Settings... → Extensions, which version number of the Notion Web Clipper do you have installed?

Chunk 2284:

 In the Safari → About Safari window, which version number of Safari are you running on your computer?

FAQs
 How is the Free Plan different from the Plus Plan?
 The Plus Plan supports additional members, so multiple people can share a collaborative workspace together. It also includes some extra features like more version history, larger file uploads and more guests.
 What is a block?

Chunk 2303:
A block is any single piece of content you add to your page, like a paragraph of text, a to-do item, an image, a code block, an embedded file, etc. Think of your page as being made up of these building blocks.
 Can I use Notion for free?
 Absolutely! The Free Plan is completely free for individual use.
 If you add additional members to the Free Plan, you can collaborate with with a limit block trial, which provides more than enough to try out Notion with your team before upgrading to the Plus Plan.
 Do you offer student discounts?
 The Plus Plan (with a 1-member limit) is free for students and educators. Compared to the Free Plan, you’ll be able to add more guests, have access to more version history, and upload larger files.

Chunk 2304:
Just sign up with your school email address and you’ll immediately gain access to these features. Thousands of school email domains are eligible, not just .edu!
 For more info & FAQs, visit the Notion for Education page.
 What are the admin tools in the Plus Plan and Enterprise Plan?
 On the Plus Plan and Enterprise Plan, the admin tools let you limit Workspace owner rights to specific people only, so that only Workspace owners can change billing information, add more teammates, or change important workspace settings.
 Admin tools are not available on the Free Plan, where every member is an admin by default.
 How is pricing calculated for the paid plans?

Chunk 2305:
If you upgrade your workspace to one of the paid plans, you will be charged a fee per member.
 Guests are free of charge – but they can only access individual pages they are invited to. In other words, guests won’t be able to see all the team pages under the Teamspaces section in the left sidebar.
 Do you have monthly and yearly billing options?
 Yes! We offer both monthly and yearly billing options, but you save more with yearly billing. Find more information on monthly and yearly pricing for our plans here →
 How does adding and removing members work?

Chunk 2306:
Whether you're on a monthly or yearly billing schedule, your account may be charged on a monthly basis if you make changes in membership. If you added members, your account will be charged a prorated amount based on the percentage of the billing cycle left when a user was added. If you removed members, you will not receive credit but instead will still have use of that seat for a different user for the remainder of the billing period.
 What happens when I change plans?
• Upgrading your plan: Your account will be upgraded and charged immediately. The amount due will be reduced based on the percentage of the billing cycle left at the time the plan was changed.

Chunk 2307:
• Downgrading your plan: Your account will be downgraded at the end of your billing cycle.
 Upgrading your plan: Your account will be upgraded and charged immediately. The amount due will be reduced based on the percentage of the billing cycle left at the time the plan was changed.
 Downgrading your plan: Your account will be downgraded at the end of your billing cycle.
 How do I cancel my paid plan?

Chunk 2308:
Your Notion subscription, annual or monthly, will automatically renew until you cancel it. You can cancel your subscription by going to "Settings & members" in the left-hand sidebar on a desktop computer, then selecting "Billing," then "Change plan." After you cancel, you’ll still have access to all the paid features until the end of your billing cycle.
 More on billing & payment here
 What happens if my payment fails? Like if my credit card expires?
 Your account email will be notified after each failed payment. Payments may be retried up to 8 times within the next month.
 After this, if the payment did not succeed, your workspace will get restricted to view-only for a period of time before being downgraded to the Free plan.

Chunk 2309:
Can I change my payment method?
 You can change your payment method at any time in your billing settings.
 How do refunds work?
 Our refund policy is simple. If you believe you've made a mistake signing up for a paid Notion subscription online or in-app, please contact us inside the app or email team@makenotion.com. We'll be happy to refund you the full amount (not pro-rated) if you downgrade your subscription within 72 hours of signing up for monthly billing, or within 30 days of signing up for annual billing.

Chunk 2310:
If you have accidentally added members to your workspace, you can remove those members at any time. If you’ve been charged for members who were accidentally added, we're happy to provide a refund of the prorated charges if you reach out within 72 hours of the invoice date (please make sure the additional members have been removed from your workspace when writing in).
 And if for any reason you're unhappy with Notion, please let us know at team@makenotion.com — we'd love to hear your feedback, and will be happy to work with you to create the best experience possible.
 Do you have a Service-Level Agreement (SLA)?

 Contact sales to learn more

Chunk 2311:
How is my payment being processed?

 Can I change my plan settings on mobile?
 No, you can only make modifications to your Notion plan on desktop or web.

Notion billing basics
You're billed per member

Chunk 2317:
Notion uses a billing model that charges you based on the number of seats, or licenses, you are using in your workspace. One seat is assigned to each member (not guest) in your workspace. This billing model gives you the flexibility to change which specific people join your Notion workspace as a member, without accruing new charges every time you add a new user.
 Here’s an example:
• Your team is working with three contractors, who have been added as members to your Notion instance. When their contracts are finished, you remove them from your Notion workspace.

Chunk 2318:
• Until the end of your billing period (monthly or annual), you will still have three paid seats in Notion that you can instead fill with new contractors, new hires, interns, or anyone else who you might want to add to your workspace as a member.

 Learn more about workspace members and how to manage them here →

Chunk 2319:
When you add members to your workspace:
• Regardless of whether you're paying yearly or monthly, our system reviews how many members you've added and issues invoices on a monthly basis.
• You only pay for the fraction of the billing interval that a member belonged to your workspace.
• Because you pay at the beginning of every billing interval, these charges for changes made in the middle of a billing interval are added retroactively to your next invoice.
• On a monthly plan, this means you get your regular monthly invoice billing you for the month ahead (including new members), but the invoice will also include retroactive prorated charges for the members you added during your last billing interval.

 On a monthly plan, this means you get your regular monthly invoice billing you for the month ahead (including new members), but the invoice will also include retroactive prorated charges for the members you added during your last billing interval.

Chunk 2321:
• On a yearly plan, this means you'll receive an invoice at the next month mark (on the same calendar date you bought your plan) that will include two things:The amount due for each new member for the remainder of your year-long plan.Retroactive charges for those new members prorated based on the amount of time they've belonged to your workspace.
• The amount due for each new member for the remainder of your year-long plan.

 Retroactive charges for those new members prorated based on the amount of time they've belonged to your workspace.
 When you remove members from your workspace:
• After removing members, you will still have access to any existing paid seats until the end of your billing interval. You can add new members to fill these seats at no additional charge.

Chunk 2323:
• When your billing interval ends, we will recalculate the total number of paid seats in use in your workspace and bill you accordingly.

 Go to Settings in your sidebar → People to view how many paid seats your workspace has, how many members are currently in your workspace, and when you'll be billed next. You can easily manage the members in your workspace here.
We bill you upfront

Chunk 2324:
You always pay for Notion at the start of your billing interval. If you make changes in the middle of a billing interval, we'll prorate how much you're charged, so that you only pay for what you actually used. These prorations will be applied at the start of the next billing interval.
Every workspace is billed separately
 You can create multiple workspaces per account (in other words, per email address you signed up with), in which case you'd receive multiple bills. This is why you might see multiple charges for Notion even if you have only one account.
• If you have multiple workspaces, you'll be billed based on how many members you have in each (on a Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan).

Chunk 2325:
• Even if the same people are in multiple workspaces, you'll be charged for them in each one.
 If you have multiple workspaces, you'll be billed based on how many members you have in each (on a Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan).
 Even if the same people are in multiple workspaces, you'll be charged for them in each one.
Your billing interval is set at the workspace level
 You could have one workspace billed annually and one billed monthly. You pay less when you choose annual billing. Everyone who joins your workspace will add an additional charge based on the interval of that workspace.
Yearly vs. monthly billing
 You can choose to pay for Notion on a yearly or monthly basis. This impacts both how much you pay and when you pay.

Chunk 2326:
• Yearly billing costs less.
• Your plan renews automatically either once a year or once a month. If you pay yearly, your plan will renew on the same calendar day you first purchased it for all following years.If you pay monthly, the same is true of each following month.For example, a yearly plan bought on May 3 will renew May 3 the next year, and a monthly plan renews June 3.
• If you pay yearly, your plan will renew on the same calendar day you first purchased it for all following years.
• If you pay monthly, the same is true of each following month.
• For example, a yearly plan bought on May 3 will renew May 3 the next year, and a monthly plan renews June 3.

Chunk 2327:
• Your bill adjusts for your paid seat count either once a year or once a month.If you pay yearly, the number of licenses you are paying for will be recalculated and reflected in your billing once a year, on the same calendar date as when you first purchased Notion.This is the only time during the year when your billing will change to reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.If you pay monthly, this recalculation will occur once a month on the same calendar date. Your billing will reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.When your plan renews, you will only be billed for the number of members currently in the workspace. This means your bill will go down if you have removed members since your last bill, and it will go up if you have added members since your last bill.

Chunk 2328:
• If you pay yearly, the number of licenses you are paying for will be recalculated and reflected in your billing once a year, on the same calendar date as when you first purchased Notion.
• This is the only time during the year when your billing will change to reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.

 When your plan renews, you will only be billed for the number of members currently in the workspace. This means your bill will go down if you have removed members since your last bill, and it will go up if you have added members since your last bill.
 If you expect your team size to fluctuate often, or you’d like more control over your budget, we recommend a monthly billing interval.
See your plan and billing details

Chunk 2333:
Note: Only workspace owners can view and manage plans and billing.
 To view the details of your plan and your billing information:
 Go to Settings in your sidebar.
 Click Billing in the sidebar of the pop-up window.
 At the top, you'll see which plan you're on, how much you're paying for it either yearly or monthly, and the date it will renew.

Change from monthly to yearly

Chunk 2334:
When you change from monthly to yearly, you'll establish a new billing cycle, with your plan automatically renewing on the calendar day you made this change the next year.
 Whatever amount of time is left on your already paid monthly cycle will be subtracted from your annual payment.
 For example:
• Let's say you’re on the Plus Plan, billed monthly.
• By April 15, you love Notion so much that you switch to a yearly billing interval.
• You already paid for part of the month, so we prorate the price of your yearly plan.
• Since half the month went by, we remove the unused time (the latter half of the month) from your yearly price.

Understanding your invoice

Chunk 2336:
Your invoice might look different from what you expect, and this could be for several reasons:
• You've added or subtracted members from your workspace during the billing interval. Note that when you add new members to your yearly Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan, you'll be charged for an entire year of Notion for each of them.
• You changed your billing interval from monthly to yearly, or vice versa.
• You upgraded your plan during a billing interval. In this case, we charge you your previous rate for the time you had that plan, and your new rate for the time you had your upgraded plan. It's a blend of both!
• You've applied credits to your balance due.

Payment methods

Chunk 2338:
On Notion for web, you can pay for your plan with a debit or credit card, or Apple Pay. If you're in Europe, we also accept payment through SEPA direct debit (not credit transfer). You can also use Stripe Link to pay with a saved card or save your card for future use on any Stripe checkout. Notion uses Stripe to process payments.
 On an i OS device, you can pay with Apple Pay. Unfortunately, you can't make payments in the Android app at this time.

Chunk 2339:
If you pay with debit or credit card, you're charged upfront for the month or year you're about to spend on Notion. If you pay with SEPA direct debit, you’ll receive a debit notification email. If you have been approved to pay via ACH or bank transfer, you'll receive an emailed invoice on the first day of your billing interval.
 Note: All valid billing credits will expire six months from the date they are generated. Once credits have expired, they can’t be reinstated.
Update your payment method & billing information
 Go to Settings in your sidebar.
 Click Billing in the sidebar of the window that pops up.
 Click Edit method next to your payment method.
 Enter the information for your payment method.
 When you’re done, click Update.
SEPA

Chunk 2340:
If you’re using SEPA for the first time to pay for your Notion plan, note that payment must fully process before you can make any changes to your plan, add or remove AI, or update your payment method. We also won’t be able to assist with refunds while your payment is processing.
 You can, however, add or remove members from your workspace during this time. These changes will be reflected in your next invoice.
Refunds

Chunk 2341:
Our refund policy is simple. If you believe you've made a mistake signing up for a paid Notion subscription online or in-app, please contact us inside the app or email team@makenotion.com. We'll be happy to refund you the full amount if you downgrade your subscription within 72 hours of signing up for monthly billing, or within 30 days of signing up for annual billing.

FAQs
 Why aren't I getting emailed invoices?
 We don't send email invoices at this time, but you can download a PDF version by going to the Billing tab in Settings.
 Does Notion offer startup discounts?
 Yes! Startups can apply to get up to 6 months free, including unlimited AI. Learn more and apply here!
 Can I pay with Pay Pal or Alipay?
 At this time, we don't support payments using Pay Pal or Alipay.
 My paid workspace just got downgraded to a free plan. What happened?
 You may have an unpaid invoice on your account — our system will automatically downgrade a paid account after several attempts are made to collect payment.

Chunk 2343:
That said, you can re-upgrade via the Upgrade tab in Settings and settle your unpaid invoices from there. Send us a message if you need help!
 I just upgraded to a paid plan, but one of my workspaces still says it's on a free plan.
 Plans only apply to a single workspace and don't cover your whole account. We recommend using the fewest workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized. More on that here.
 How can I avoid needing multiple workspaces?

Chunk 2344:
We've seen people create multiple workspace instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, their executive team, etc. so they can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. You don't need to do this. Instead:
• Disable Workspace Access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.
• On every page, grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.

Chunk 2345:
• So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top-level page for that team, turn on Full Access for only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!

Chunk 2412:
Notion’s single sign-on (SSO) services are built upon the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0 standard that permits identity managers to safely pass authorization credentials to service providers like Notion and connect your Identity Provider (Id P) and workspace(s) for an easier, more secure login experience.
What is SAML SSO?
 SSO services permit a user to use one set of credentials (for example, a name or email address and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the end user only once for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session.

Chunk 2413:
Note: SAML SSO is available for workspaces on Notion's Business or Enterprise Plans. Contact sales to learn more →
Benefits of SSO
• Streamlines user management across systems for workspace owners.
• Removes the need for end-users to remember and manage multiple passwords. Simplifies end-users experience by allowing them to sign in at one single access point and enjoy a seamless experience across multiple applications.

Setting up SAML SSO for your workspace
Prerequisites for SSO with Notion
• Your workspace must be on a Business Plan or Enterprise Plan.
• Your Identity Provider (Id P) must support the SAML 2.0 standard.
• Only a workspace owner can configure SAML SSO for a Notion workspace.
• At least one domain has been verified by a workspace owner.
 Your workspace must be on a Business Plan or Enterprise Plan.
 Your Identity Provider (Id P) must support the SAML 2.0 standard.
 Only a workspace owner can configure SAML SSO for a Notion workspace.
 At least one domain has been verified by a workspace owner.

Chunk 2415:
Enable SAML SSO for a single workspace
 Go to Settings & members, then select the Settings tab.
 In the Allow email domains section, remove all email domains.
 Then select the Identity & provisioning tab.
 Verify one or more domains. See instructions for domain verification here →
 Toggle on Enable SAML SSO and the SAML SSO Configuration modal will automatically appear and prompt you to complete the set-up.
 The SAML SSO Configuration modal is divided into two parts:
• The Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL is to be entered in your Identity Provider (Id P) portal
• The Identity Provider Details is a field in which either an Id P URL or Id P metadata XML must be provided to Notion.

Chunk 2416:
The Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL is to be entered in your Identity Provider (Id P) portal
 The Identity Provider Details is a field in which either an Id P URL or Id P metadata XML must be provided to Notion.
 For more information on where to enter and obtain this information, please refer to our Id P-specific guides below.
 Note: Guests are not supported with SAML SSO on Notion.
Link additional workspaces to an existing SAML SSO configuration
 From the workspace where you have verified your domain and enabled SAML SSO, there is a Linked workspaces section listing all of the workspaces associated with your SAML SSO configuration.

Chunk 2417:
Users with a verified email address who have access to the primary workspace or one of the linked workspaces will be able to log in via SAML SSO.Sales-assisted Enterprise customers can add Enterprise workspaces to their SAML SSO configuration or remove them by reaching out to team@makenotion.com.
Enforce SAML SSO
 Once you have completed your configuration of SAML SSO for a single workspace, users will be able to log in via SAML SSO in addition to other log-in methods such as username/password and Google Authentication.
• To ensure users can only log in using SAML SSO and no other method, update the Login method to Only SAML SSO. Once this happens, workspace users will be logged out and required to log back in using SAML SSO.

Chunk 2418:
To ensure users can only log in using SAML SSO and no other method, update the Login method to Only SAML SSO. Once this happens, workspace users will be logged out and required to log back in using SAML SSO.
• SAML SSO will only be enforced for users who use your verified domain and have access to the primary workspace or a linked workspace.
• Guests invited to pages in a Notion workspace can’t use SAML SSO to login. Instead, they’ll always use their e-mail and password or log in with Google or Apple.

Chunk 2419:
• Workspace owners will always have the option to bypass SAML SSO by using their email and password credentials. This is to allow them to access Notion in the event of Id P/SAML failure. They will be able to log in and disable or update their configuration.

Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning
 Notion supports Just-in-Time provisioning when using SAML SSO. This allows someone signing in via SAML SSO to join the workspace automatically as a member.
 To enable Just-in-Time provisioning:
• In Settings & members → Identity & provisioning, make sure that Automatic account creation is enabled.
 In Settings & members → Identity & provisioning, make sure that Automatic account creation is enabled.

Chunk 2421:
Note: We don’t recommend enabling Just-in Time provisioning if you are using SCIM. Having an “allowed email domain” in place allows users on that domain to join the workspace so there could be a mismatch between membership in their Identity Providers and Notion.
Identity Provider (Id P) Setup
 These are instructions for setting up Notion SAML SSO with Entra ID (formerly Azure), Google, Okta, and One Login. If you use a different Identity Provider and need assistance with configuration, please contact our support team.

 SSO not be enforced during the transition, so you can minimize the risk of locking users out.
 Email addresses for the users under your new Id P match the user’s email in Notion.

Chunk 2445:
Note: Changing identity providers does not end user sessions or deactivate users.
Troubleshooting
 If you encounter errors when setting up SAML SSO, check to make sure your Id P's metadata, SAML requests and responses are valid XML against the SAML XSD schemas. You can do so using this online tool: https://www.samltool.com/validate_xml.php
 Note that we do not support the Entities Descriptor element. If your Id P's metadata contains this element, extract the contained Entity Descriptor element and try again.
FAQs
 Why is the current Enable SAML SSO greyed out?

Chunk 2446:
The most common reason is that you have not yet verified ownership of a domain. If this is the case, you will notice that you either don’t have any domains listed in the verify email domain section or the domain is pending verification.
 For next steps, refer to our instructions on how to complete domain verification here →
 Why can’t I edit the SAML SSO settings?

Chunk 2447:
The most common reason is that you are trying to modify the verified domains or SSO configuration from a linked workspace which is a workspace that is already associated with another SSO configuration.In linked workspaces, all domain management and SSO configuration settings are read-only. To modify the SSO configuration or remove this workspace from the SSO configuration, you must have access to the primary workspace. The name of the primary workspace can be found at the top of the Identity & Provisioning settings tab.
 Why do I need to verify a domain to enable SSO?
 We ask that the email domain ownership is validated to ensure that only the owner of the domain can customize how their users log into Notion.

Chunk 2448:
Having trouble setting up SSO? Here are some common issues:
• Try using a URL instead of an XML.
• We recommend testing the setup process with a test account before enforcing it for users.
• If neither of these options help, reach out to support at team@makenotion.com.
 Try using a URL instead of an XML.
 We recommend testing the setup process with a test account before enforcing it for users.
 If neither of these options help, reach out to support at
 team@makenotion.com.
 Why should I remove email domains from the “Allowed Email Domains” setting before configuring SAML SSO for my workspace?

Chunk 2449:
The “Allowed Email Domain” setting allows users with the selected domains to access your workspace without being provisioned via your Id P. To ensure that only users provisioned via your Id P can access your SAML-enabled workspace, disable this feature by removing all email addresses from the “Allowed Email Domain” list.
 Can I still log in to Notion if my identity provider is out of service?
 Yes, even with SAML enforced, Workspace owners have the option to log in with email. Thereafter, a Workspace owner can change the SAML configuration to disable Enforce SAML so users may log in with email again.
 Are profile photos transmitted to Notion from the Id P?

Chunk 2450:
Yes, profile Photo is an optional custom attribute. You may assign this attribute to a corresponding attribute in your Id P, provided the attribute contains the URL to an image. If the profile Photo field is set, this image will replace the avatar in Notion when the user signs in using SAML SSO.
 How do I allow admins of other workspaces in my SAML configuration create new workspaces?
 Only the admins of your primary workspace will be able to create new workspaces using your verified domain(s). Please reach out to our support team (team@makenotion.com) to switch your primary SAML workspace to another linked workspace in your SAML configuration.

This one's for administrators of workspaces on the Enterprise Plan! Find out more about your capabilities in Notion 👤
• Workspace owner
• Membership admin
Enterprise admin types

Chunk 2454:
Workspaces on the Enterprise Plan have two admin types. Here is an overview of their capabilities within the workspace:
Workspace owner
 Workspace owners can manage everything in the workspace from settings to security, members to groups — and even delete an entire workspace. They can also approve or reject requests to invite guests to a workspace.
 Think of them as the primary administrator of the workspace with the most expansive permissions.
 Tip: We recommend you choose at least two workspace owners so there is always a backup!
Membership admin
 Membership admins are more limited administrators who can manage user membership. They can:

Chunk 2455:
• Add or remove members from the workspace.Note: Membership admins can add users to the workspace in a member role only. Membership admins cannot add workspace owners or membership admins to the workspace.
• Note: Membership admins can add users to the workspace in a member role only. Membership admins cannot add workspace owners or membership admins to the workspace.
• Add or remove members, membership admins, and workspace owners from existing groups.

This article will cover how to verify ownership of a domain and which advanced workspace security settings it will unlock for Enterprise customers 🧷
• Verify a domain for an integration

Chunk 2460:
• Customize permissions for workspace creation using your domain(s)
• Notification period
• View claimable workspaces
• Delete workspaces
• Recover workspaces
• Consolidate workspaces
 Domain verification allows Business and Enterprise workspace owners to claim ownership over an email address domain associated with their workspace. This unlocks domain management settings like configuring SAML SSO for your workspace, building Notion integrations using link previews, and controlling who can create workspaces (for Enterprise Plans only).
 Domain verification does not impact your billing.
Verify a domain for your workspace

Chunk 2461:
Note: To do this, you must be a workspace owner on a Business or Enterprise Plan.
 To verify a domain for your workspace:
 Go to Settings in your sidebar.
 Select Identity & provisioning.
 Next to Verified domains, select Add domain.
 Enter your new domain and select Next.
 Follow the prompts to update your DNS record.
 Click Verify to prompt Notion to check your DNS record.
• If your domain’s status is Pending, select
•
•
• next to the domain → View details → Verify to manually verify it.
 If your domain’s status is Pending, select
•
•
• next to the domain → View details → Verify to manually verify it.
 Once verification is complete, you’ll receive a confirmation email and your domain’s status will be Verified.
 Note:

Chunk 2462:
• Typically, a change in the DNS record takes only minutes to propagate; however, there are cases where it may take up to 72 hours.
• You must verify a domain within one week of adding the domain. After a week, the verification code will expire and you’ll have to repeat the steps above.

 You can customize permissions for who can create new workspaces using your verified domain(s).
 In Settings & members, go to Identity & provisioning and then Workspace creation.
 Select Anyone to allow any user with your verified domain to create a new workspace.
 Select Workspace owners to prevent users with your verified domain from creating new workspaces.
 Note: The default setting for workspace creation permissions once a domain is verified is workspace owners only.
Enabling Domain Claim
 Once a domain is verified, workspace owners on the Enterprise Plan can transfer, delete, or claim ownership over non-Enterprise workspaces created by users with their verified domain.

Chunk 2465:
Prerequisites for viewing claimable workspaces
• You must be a workspace owner on the Enterprise Plan.
• Verified domain is a non-educational domain.

 At least one current workspace owner (either the creator or someone else) is using the verified corporate email address.
 Workspace is not on the Enterprise Plan.
Notification period
 Once a workspace owner verifies a domain, an automated email will be sent to all workspace owners of workspaces created with that domain, notifying them that their workspaces are eligible to be claimed.

Chunk 2468:
During this 14 day notification period, workspace owners can only request ownership transfers on single-member workspaces. They will be unable to delete single-member workspaces or claim multi-member workspaces.
 After a domain is verified, users who create new workspaces with a verified domain will be notified upon creation that their workspace is eligible to be claimed.
View claimable workspaces
 Once a domain is verified, Enterprise workspace owners can view all non-enterprise workspaces created by users with their verified domain. This view can be found in your workspace security settings in the Identity & provisioning tab under the Domain management section.
 For each workspace, this view includes:
• Plan type

Chunk 2469:
• Workspace owners
• Created at
• Created by
 Workspace name
 Plan type
 Number of members
 Workspace owners
 Created at
 Created by
 Workspace owners can take the following actions on their claimable workspaces:
• Request ownership change on single-member workspaces.
• Delete single-member workspaces.
• Claim multi-member workspaces.
 Request ownership change on single-member workspaces.
 Delete single-member workspaces.
 Claim multi-member workspaces.
 Workspace owners can also export the list of claimable workspaces as a CSV.
 Click on Settings & members in your sidebar and go to Identity & provisioning.
 Click on Browse workspaces and then Export to CSV in the top right.
Change workspace ownership

Chunk 2470:
With domain management, workspace owners on the Enterprise Plan can request a change in ownership transfer on single-member workspaces using a verified domain to a non-corporate email address. This is especially helpful when users created a workspace using a corporate email address, but use the workspace primarily for personal projects.
 Workspace owners need to initiate the change request in the workspace security settings. In the workspace settings, navigate to the Identity & provisioning tab and Browse workspaces in the Domain management section. From the claimable workspace view, complete the following steps:
 Select the single-member workspace that you would like to change.
 In the
•
•
• menu, select Require account change.

Chunk 2471:
Provide a contact email for questions from users about the request and confirm the action.
 In the view, the workspace will enter a Pending state.
 When the change request is submitted, an email notification will be sent to the workspace owner of the selected workspace and the user will not be able to access their workspace until they have completed the remaining transfer steps as follows:
 Log into the workspace.
 Follow the instructions and change email address associated with the account to a non-corporate email address. Note: While a single-member workspace ownership change is requested, the user cannot change the email associated with their user account.

Chunk 2472:
A verification code will be sent to the email address to confirm the user’s ownership of the account. Enter this verification code in the workspace.
 An automated email will be sent once the change is complete.
 Prerequisites for changing a workspace ownership
• You must be a workspace owner on an Enterprise Plan.
• The workspace to be changed must be on a single-member.
 You must be a workspace owner on an Enterprise Plan.
 The workspace to be changed must be on a single-member.
Delete workspaces

Chunk 2473:
With domain management, Enterprise workspace owners can more easily govern how a verified domain is used and where related projects are stored on Notion. When an employee leaves a company, Enterprise workspace owners can delete their single member workspaces to cleanup old content while remaining compliant.
 Prerequisites for deleting a workspace
• You must be a workspace owner on the Enterprise Plan.
• The domain was verified at least 14 days ago.
• Workspace to be deleted must be a single-member workspace that is either free or not delinquent on payments.
 You must be a workspace owner on the Enterprise Plan.
 The domain was verified at least 14 days ago.

Chunk 2474:
Workspace to be deleted must be a single-member workspace that is either free or not delinquent on payments.
 Note: Single-member workspaces that are deleted by an Enterprise workspace owner using domain management are not eligible for refunds or credits.
 In the workspace settings, navigate to the Identity & provisioning tab and select Browse workspaces in the Domain management section. From the claimable workspace view, complete the following steps:
 Select the single-member workspace you would like to delete
 Click the
•
•
• menu and select Delete workspace
 Provide a contact email for questions from users about the deletion and confirm the action

Chunk 2475:
In the workspace view, a Recover button will appear next to the selected workspace. When the deletion is initiated, an email notification will be sent to the workspace owner of the selected workspace. The single member workspace owner will immediately lose access to their workspace.
 Note: Enterprise workspace owner will have 30 days to recover the workspace if needed. After 30 days, the workspace will be permanently deleted automatically.
 Workspace was deleted by mistake?
 If you receive an email notification about a workspace that has been deleted accidentally instead of transferred, please reach out to your respective Enterprise workspace owner provided in the email notification directly.

Chunk 2476:
Note: Only the Enterprise workspace owner who initiated the deletion can recover deleted workspaces. Notion Support cannot override Enterprise workspace owner actions to restore deleted workspaces.
Recover workspaces
 To recover a deleted workspace, the Enterprise workspace owner that initiated the deletion can do this in the workspace settings: navigate to the Identity & provisioning tab and select Browse workspaces in the Domain management section. From the claimable workspace view, complete the following steps:
 Go to the single-member workspace you would like to recover.
 Click on the Recover button for the workspace and confirm.
 In the view the workspace will now appear without the recover button.

Chunk 2477:
The owner of the single-member workspace will regain access to their workspace and their workspace content will be restored.
 The workspace owner of the single-member workspace selected for deletion can request Notion Support extend the recovery timeframe by 30 days from the day they contact Support. After the recovery timeframe expires workspace data will be permanently deleted.
 When a workspace is recovered, all page content in the workspace will be restored and the single-member workspace owner will regain access.
 The following content cannot be recovered:
• Guest access
• Configured integrations (Bots)
• Domains (custom Notion domains)
 Favorites
 Guest access
 Configured integrations (Bots)
 Domains (custom Notion domains)

Chunk 2478:
Claim workspaces
 With domain management, workspace owners can establish authorized workspaces for employees to collaborate by claiming ownership over eligible multi-member workspaces.
 Note: If you’re on the Enterprise plan with quarterly true-ups, please work with your dedicated Account Management team to claim workspaces and bring them under your Enterprise License.
 In the workspace security settings, navigate to the Identity & provisioning tab and Browse workspaces in the Domain management section. From the claimable workspaces view, complete the following steps:
 Select the multi-member workspace that you would like to claim ownership.
 Verify payment information (only credit card payments are supported).

Chunk 2479:
Review and accept the billing implications of claiming the workspace.
 When the claim of ownership is processed:
• Claimed workspace will be upgraded to the Enterprise Plan.
• Workspace owner that claimed the workspace will become the only workspace owner.
• Previous workspace owners are downgraded to members (workspace owners can re-assign roles and permissions as necessary).
 Claimed workspace will be upgraded to the Enterprise Plan.

FAQs
 How do I know if domain ownership verification is complete?
 If domain ownership verification is complete, the verified domain will appear in a green color scheme.
 My domain is displayed in red. What does this mean?
 If the domain is displayed in red that means that either the domain ownership has already been verified in another workspace or the Notion-provided verification code has expired (it expires after 1 week).
 To verify the domain, please restart the verification process from the beginning.
 My domain is displayed in yellow. What does this mean?

Chunk 2484:
If the domain is displayed in yellow, that means it’s pending validation. You need to either complete the instructions to update the DNS record or click Verify in the Verification modal.
 I verified my domain in the past with the help of the Notion Support team. What will my workspace creation permissions be?
 If you verified your domain before the functionality to customize permissions for workspace creation was supported, your setting will remain as Anyone can create a workspace using your verified domain(s).
 Why would I want to verify more than one domain?

Chunk 2485:
If you own multiple domains – e.g. acme.com and example.com – and you plan to use SAML SSO to manage users from these domains or customize their permissions to create new workspaces, you might want to verify multiple domains.
 Who is restricted from creating a workspace when the setting is Only Workspace Owners?
 Users from your verified domain will be restricted from creating new workspaces. Only workspace owners of the workspace where the domains have been verified, will be able to create workspaces.
 What can workspace owners do with domain management?

Chunk 2486:
Domain management features help Workspace owners better control and secure their workspaces. You can configure SAML SSO for your workspace, build Notion integrations using link previews, and control who can create workspaces (for Enterprise plans only).
 What is visible to workspace owners with domain management?
 Owners of a domain will be able to see a list of workspaces that were created using the corporate domain, including information such as the list of workspace owners, number of members, and created date. They will not be able to see the content within the workspace.
 What does it mean when a workspaces is in a pending state?

Chunk 2487:
Once a domain claim request has been submitted, the workspace will remain in the pending state in the workspace view until the claim has been processed.
 Why can’t I claim a single-member workspace? I don’t want to delete it or request an account switch.
 Consolidating workspaces to your primary workspace is coming soon. In the meantime, you can work with the workspace owner of the single-member workspace to move content in your primary workspace.
 Why can’t I delete a multi-member workspace?

Chunk 2488:
Deleting a multi-member workspace is not supported in the domain management workspace view, but once you’ve successfully claimed a multi-member workspace you can follow the instructions to permanently delete the workspace as the new, sole workspace owner.
 Why can’t I claim ownership of a workspace when it’s eligible to be claimed?
 If your claim request is not getting processed, it’s likely that the workspace you’re trying to claim is either:
• In the 14 day waiting period after a domain is newly verified
 In a delinquent state on payments
 In the 14 day waiting period after a domain is newly verified
 Can I merge workspaces?

Chunk 2489:
Consolidating workspaces to your primary workspace is coming soon. In the meantime, you can claim workspaces and manually move content to a primary workspace.

Generate your SCIM API token

Chunk 2497:
Enterprise Plan workspace owners can generate and view SCIM API tokens by going to Settings & members → Identity & provisioning → SCIM provisioning.
 To generate a new token, click on the + New token button in the right corner.
 A unique token is generated for each workspace owner that only they can view.
Revoke tokens
 When a workspace owner leaves the workspace or their role is changed, their token will be revoked. When this happens, an automated message will be sent to the remaining workspace owners to notify them to replace the revoked token.
 In addition, active tokens can be revoked by any of the workspace owners in the workspace. To revoke a token, click the 🗑 alongside the respective token.
Replace existing tokens

Chunk 2498:
If a token is revoked, you will need to replace it in any existing integrations.
 Any SCIM integration and user provisioning relying on the revoked token will be disabled until it is replaced by an active token.
 Note: To avoid breaking existing integrations, make sure to replace any tokens associated with an admin before de-provisioning them.
Suppress invite emails
 To control whether users will receive invitations to workspaces and groups via email when provisioned by SCIM, Enterprise Plan workspaces owners can go to Settings & members → Identity & provisioning → SCIM provisioning → Suppress invite emails from SCIM provisioning. Toggle this setting on if you don’t want to send emails to users.

This article outlines how a workspace owner can transfer content from a member who has been deprovisioned from an Enterprise Plan workspace 📖
• When can a workspace owner transfer content?
• Reassign content

Chunk 2551:
• Restore a user's content and access
When can a workspace owner transfer content?
 When a user is deleted, deprovisioned, or leaves a workspace, they may leave behind private page content. This feature allows a workspace owner of an Enterprise Plan workspace to transfer this content to another, current user so it is easily recovered.
 Note: This process applies on a user’s private content after they have left a workspace. Content shared with a current workspace member will not be transferrable.
 A workspace owner is able to reassign the private content of a user who has recently left the workspace if:
• The user is not currently part of the workspace (they have been deprovisioned).
• The user had private pages.

Chunk 2552:
• The user’s private pages were not already reassigned to another user.
• The user was part of the workspace fewer than 30 days ago.
• The workspace is on an Enterprise Plan subscription.
 The user is not currently part of the workspace (they have been deprovisioned).
 The user had private pages.
 The user’s private pages were not already reassigned to another user.
 The user was part of the workspace fewer than 30 days ago.
 The workspace is on an Enterprise Plan subscription.
Reassign content
 Visit your Settings & members and click the Members section.
 Navigate to the Recently left users tab.

Chunk 2553:
For the user who has been deprovisioned (the “recently left user”), select the destination where you would like to send the deprovisioned user’s private pages.
 You will see a confirmation modal; select Transfer private pages to continue the private page transfer process.
 All of the deprovisioned user's private pages will appear in the destination user’s sidebar, nested under a new top-level private page.
 Note: A user who has had all their private pages reassigned will no longer be visible in the Recently left list.
Restore a user's content and access
 If a user has left and rejoined a workspace within the last 30 days, workspace owners will be able to restore their private pages, shared pages, group membership, and teamspace membership.

Chunk 2554:
To do this, simply add a member back to your workspace and their content and access will be automatically restored once they rejoin.

FAQs
 I just made updates to a page, but I didn't receive a Slack notification.

Chunk 2652:
There's a five minute delay built in to prevent these notifications from getting too noisy! Let us know if you still aren't seeing them show up! We'll help out.
 I'm trying to enable the integration in Slack's App Directory, but it just takes me to Notion's homepage.
 Sorry for the confusion 🙈You can't enable the integration from Slack. You'll need to turn it on inside Notion with the instructions on this page.
 What permissions are granted when the Slack integration is enabled?
 Notion's integration with Slack operates on a per-page basis. When you enable the Slack integration for a specific page in your Notion workspace, you're granting Notion access to publish updates to the Slack channel of your choosing.

Chunk 2653:
Can I add more than one login for a link preview integration?
 You can! You can do so via Settings & Members → My connections. For the desired integration, select “Connect another account”.
 Note: Some applications do not support multi-account login in the browser (e.g. Git Hub), so you might need to logout of whichever account is currently logged in on your browser to be prompted to login with a different account.
 We’ll determine which of your accounts to use to preview given resources and show an error if none of them are successful.
 I’m receiving a general  “Can’t load preview” error in my link preview.
 Run through these steps to try to resolve.
 Confirm you’ve authenticated with the correct account for the resource.

Chunk 2654:
Confirm no access restrictions for your organization.
 Delete your integration in Notion via the My connection settings. You may also want to revoke the integration the corresponding platform: Git Hub, Jira, Slack, Asana,   Trello.
 Try to unfurl again.
 Finally, if all else fails, reach out to support! Unfortunately, we cannot help resolve errors related to Access denied or Content not found. Please provide the following information when reaching out to support:
• Integration you’re trying to use
• URL you’re trying to preview (if possible)
 Integration you’re trying to use
 Error message and code
 URL you’re trying to preview (if possible)
 I’m receiving an “Access denied” or “Content not found” error in my link preview.

Chunk 2655:
There are two possible reasons for this:
 You may not have authenticated with the account that has access. You can connect multiple accounts either through Settings & Members → My connections, or the error drop down.
 Your organization may have limited access to content via 3rd party integrations or IP addresses. Please confirm with your workspace or organization administrator and ask to have Notion’s integration approved if this is the case. Here are instructions for specific integrations: Git Hub, Jira, Slack, Asana, Trello.

• Analytics glossary

Chunk 2670:
Workspace analytics is an Enterprise Plan feature that provides a comprehensive overview of how your organization is engaging with content across the workspace.
 With insights on adoption, engagement, and search behavior, you'll be able to fine-tune your workspace to better serve the specific needs of your team.
 Note: Your workspace analytics data is tracked starting on the day that you sign up for the Enterprise plan — you will not have any analytics from before that day.
Accessing workspace analytics
 To access workspace analytics click on Settings & members in your sidebar and click Analytics.
 You’ll see an overview of information regarding content in your workspace, including most active teamspaces, viewers and editors.

Chunk 2671:
Select the Members, Content or Search tabs to get more thorough breakdowns. If you’re not a workspace owner, you’ll only have access to Content.
Member engagement
 In the Members tab, you can analyze how members are adopting and engaging with workspace content. You’ll see a graph that displays active members over the last 90 days.
 There’s also a list of workspace members with their activity. Note that any member who opts out of analytics will appear with a strikeout eye icon.

Chunk 2687:
From this dashboard, workspace owners can search for users by name, email, or ID. Additionally, they can filter by workspace and 2-step verification method.
 Note: Suspended users remain as billable seats to whatever workspaces they are a part of.
 All of their content and comments continue to show as normal, any integrations they set up continue to work, but their profile photo will appear as a gray crossed out silhouette.
 On a specific user's profile, workspace owners can:
• Delete the user
• Change the user's name and email address. The new email must belong to the verified domain.
• Reset the user's password
• Remove the user from external workspaces
 Suspend the user

FAQs
 Will changes to managed user accounts made by the workspace admins be tracked?
 Yes, all changes made by a workspace owner to a managed user’s account will be logged in the audit log.
 If a password is reset or a user is removed from a workspace, they will receive an email notification.
 Will users in my workspace know that their account is being managed by the workspace admin?
 Yes, users will see a badge in their My account settings.
 If my workspace is using SCIM, can I still make changes to managed user accounts through Notion?

Chunk 2689:
Updating managed user profile information from this new dashboard is not recommended if the Enterprise workspace is using the SCIM API directly or through an Identity Provider (e.g. Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace) to programmatically manage workspace members.
 If the workspace is using SCIM, then changes made from the Notion Settings UI will be replaced when the next SCIM API request syncs up.
 My workspace has verified several domains. Will I see all managed users for all of our domains together in the dashboard?
 Yes, you will see all your managed users (from multiple verified domains) together in the dashboard.
 What happens if a user is suspended?
 Suspended users remain as billable seats to whatever workspaces they are a part of.

Chunk 2690:
All of their content and comments continue to show as normal, any integrations they set up continue to work, but their profile photo will appear as a gray crossed out silhouette.
 Other users can still share pages with the suspended user, @-mention them, and add them to workspaces or teamspaces. The suspended users won’t be able login, receive any notifications, or access any of these resources. They’ll see them if/when they’re unsuspended.
 What happens if a user is deleted?
 All public or shared content created by the deleted user remains, but attributions and @-mentions change to Deleted User.

Chunk 2691:
Any private or shared pages where no remaining users have full access will be deleted. Deletions are permanent, with a 30-day grace period to cancel and restore.
 If the account may be needed in the future, it is recommended to suspend instead of delete. Deleted users do not contribute to the billable seat count of the workspace.

Learn how to install and update Notion for your organization 🚀
• Distribute Notion
• Disable automatic updates
• Allow users to update Notion

Chunk 2695:
Notion's desktop app provides IT administrators with enhanced control over installations and updates. You have the flexibility to select the installation path for Notion and manage update settings. By default, the Notion app is set up in the /Applications folder on your employees’ machines and is configured to update automatically with each new release.
 Note: Regular updates are crucial for access to the latest features and ensuring the highest level of security, especially if automatic updates are turned off.
Installing Notion on shared machines

Chunk 2696:
Notion allows for use on shared machines by multiple users. It can be installed in either the /Applications or ~/Applications folder of a user's machine. The best installation method depends on your organization's specific needs.
 /Applications
• All users on the machine use the same installation of Notion.
• Updates made to Notion apply to all users on the machine.
• Users must be administrators to update Notion.
 All users on the machine use the same installation of Notion.
 Updates made to Notion apply to all users on the machine.
 Users must be administrators to update Notion.
 ~/Applications
• Each user on a shared machine has their own installation of Notion.

Chunk 2697:
• Updates made to one instance of Notion do not affect other instances of Notion for other users on the same machine.
• Users do not need to be administrators to update Notion.
 Each user on a shared machine has their own installation of Notion.
 Updates made to one instance of Notion do not affect other instances of Notion for other users on the same machine.
 Users do not need to be administrators to update Notion.
Distribute Notion
 After deciding on the installation method, download the appropriate Notion desktop app build. There are three builds available: Intel (x64), Apple Silicon (arm64), and Universal (x64 or arm64). Ensure you distribute the correct build to match your employees' machine types.

Chunk 2698:
Note: The Universal build works on Intel and Apple Silicon machines. Keep in mind the installation file is much larger than the other builds.
Disable automatic updates
 Notion allows you to disable automatic updates for individual users. This feature is useful for when you want to test new Notion app versions before a widespread rollout, or if you prefer to stagger the update process. To keep the app working smoothly and securely, we advise updating Notion with each new version release.
 To prevent Notion from automatically checking for updates, run the following terminal command as each user who will be running Notion:
 defaults write notion.id Notion No Auto Updates -bool YES
 Use the following command to re-enable automatic updates:

Chunk 2699:
defaults write notion.id Notion No Auto Updates -bool NO
Allow users to update Notion
 If Notion is installed in the ~/Applications folder, users can update the app independently without needing special permissions. However, if the app is installed in the /Applications folder, update permissions are required. Users must be machine administrators and have write access to /Applications, notion.app, and all its subfiles.

Chunk 2700:
For shared machines, we recommend setting up a permissions group for all Notion users and installing Notion in a subfolder of /Applications. You can grant this group ownership and write access to the subfolder using the terminal command below. Make sure you replace group with your permissions group name and subfolder with your subfolder name:
 chown -R :group /Applications/subfolder && chmod -R 775 /Applications/subfolder

FAQs
 I'm not receiving any mobile or email notifications, but I have them enabled.
 If you have Notion open on a mobile device or computer, you won't receive push or email notifications for reminders — you'll only see the badge next to All Updates.

Chunk 2753:
If Notion is not open on your mobile device or computer, then you will receive a push or email notification.
 To always receive email updates regardless of whether or not you have the app open, you can enable Always send email notifications in the My notifications section of Settings & members.
 Is there a way for the notifications to make a sound or vibration?
 Not at the moment, unfortunately 😓 On our to-do list though!

Chunk 2757:
• Allowed email domains
• Workspace security
• Export your entire workspace
• Export workspace members
 Note: Many of these settings are only visible if you're an admin on a Plus Plan or Enterprise Plan. They don't appear in the mobile app at all. Contact sales to learn more about our Enterprise plan →
Access workspace settings
 To see your workspace management options, go to Settings in your sidebar. In the window that pops up, click on the Settings tab.
 In this window, you can:
• Change your workspace name: We recommend keeping it short and simple!

Chunk 2758:
• Change your workspace icon: Click on it to choose an emoji or upload your own image. Ideal dimensions are 280px by 280px.

Allowed email domains
 Make it simple for people with certain email address domains to automatically join your workspace as members, or as workspace owners if you're on a Free Plan. As soon as they sign up, Notion will recognize their email and ask if they want to join your workspace.

Chunk 2759:
• New allowed domains are restricted to the email domains of the members of that workspace. To add a domain that isn't available, someone with an email address from that domain will have to join the workspace.
• Use this so all new employees who join your company can easily join your shared workspace. All they have to do is sign up for Notion with their work email.
• Bear in mind that you'll be charged per member on Plus, Business, and Enterprise Plans.

Workspace security
 Depending on how you're using your workspace, you may want to keep the data you have in it private for just your team. If you have an Enterprise Plan, you can go to the Security section to adjust two kinds of settings.
 Note: Some of the following settings are available to Enterprise users only.
• Allow members to request adding other members: This setting is available on all plans.

Chunk 2761:
• Allow any user to request to be added as a member of the workspace: This setting is available on all plans.
• Allow page access requests from non-members: This setting is available to all plans except Enterprise.

Security settings available on Enterprise Plans only
• Disable public sharing: Don't let members publish Notion Sites. Any Notion Sites already live on the web will be taken down.

Chunk 2762:
• Disable duplicating pages to other workspaces: Don't let members move pages to other workspaces. Especially helpful if you have a lot of people and a lot of pages. It can get confusing fast, and some people may lose access when pages get moved.
• Disable export: Don't let members export pages. This ensures that all your data stays in Notion rather than having different versions saved as Markdown or CSV.
• Disable members inviting guests to pages Allow members to request adding guests (available if the above setting is turned on)
• Allow members to request adding guests (available if the above setting is turned on)

Export your entire workspace
 Note: You must be a workspace admin to do this.
 Your Notion data will always be backed up in the cloud, but you can also export it for safekeeping. You can export all your pages as HTML, Markdown, or CSV (for databases), along with any files you've uploaded, too.
 If you're on a Business or Enterprise Plan, you can also export your entire workspace to PDF, which can be helpful for legal and compliance backups.

Chunk 2765:
Pages that the exporter doesn't have access to, such as private pages of other users, will not be included in the export. Workspace admins on the Enterprise Plan can give themselves and others access to specific pages using content search, so that those pages can be included in future exports. Some content also may not be exported based on teamspace settings.
 A sitemap (index.html) is included the export to help you navigate the exported workspace. The list items in the sitemap are locally linked to the exported pages in HTML and Markdown formats.
 To export your workspace content:
 Go to Settings in your sidebar → Settings.
 Find and select Export all workspace content.

Chunk 2766:
You'll receive an email from Notion with a link to download your files. This link will expire after 7 days.
 Note:
• You can only export your entire workspace on desktop or web.
• You can’t instantly recreate your workspace by reuploading your exported workspace content.

FAQs
 I'm on a Plus Plan, but don't see any of these settings in Settings & Members?

Chunk 2768:
Only Workspace owners can access these workspace settings. If you navigate to the Members tab, you'll see whether you're a guest, member, Membership admin, or Workspace owner in the workspace. Ask a Workspace owner to upgrade your membership status if necessary.
 I'm trying to add a new domain to the Allowed Email Domains setting, but it won't let me.
 New allowed domains are restricted to the email domains of the members of that workspace. To add a domain that isn't available, someone with an email address from that domain will have to join the workspace.
 Does Notion support custom domains?

Chunk 2769:

• Enable HIPAA compliance
• Deactivate HIPAA compliance

Chunk 2801:
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a US federal law that was enacted in 1996 that requires the protection and confidential handling of protected health information (PHI) by covered entities such as healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates.
 This article provides users required product configurations to make their Notion workspace HIPAA compliant.
 Note: Notion's Business Associate Agreement (BAA) governs the protection of Personal Health Information (PHI) that is stored in the Notion Service. To be eligible to sign Notion’s BAA, you must subscribe to our Enterprise Plan.

Chunk 2802:
Notion Calendar, any Notion Calendar features, and any Beta Services are not covered by the BAA and therefore may not be used or deployed in a manner that processes protected health information.
 To the extent that any language on this page and language found in the BAA conflict at any time, the BAA shall control.

 Verify domain(s): To use advanced security features, you must verify ownership of your email domain. This is an automated process that involves adding a TXT record onto your domain’s DNS to verify your ownership of it.
 Enable SAML SSO: This will toggle the feature on and complete the configuration. For more information on completing the SAML SSO configuration, please refer to this article.

Chunk 2804:
Change default login method: Once SAML SSO is enabled for the first time, the default login method will be set to Any method, meaning that users have the option of logging in via SAML or their normal login method. By setting this to Only SAML SSO, this enforces SAML as the login method for your workspace for managed users with verified company emails.
 Link additional workspaces: If you have more than one workspace you’d like to configure with SSO, you can do so by reaching out to team@makenotion.com.

Chunk 2805:
Once properly configured, any members signing into your workspace(s) will need to use the verified domain and will need to be authenticated through your identity provider. Enterprise workspace owners are able to bypass by using an alternative login method in case there’s an Id P/SAML SSO failure.
 Unique User Identification
 Assign a unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity.

Chunk 2806:
Notion has a SCIM API which can be used to provision, manage, and de-provision members and groups. Workspace owners can find the required API key by going to Settings → Security & identity → SCIM Configuration and clicking to view the token.Please see our SCIM documentation for the latest information on how you can interact with Notion’s SCIM API. Notion supports official SCIM applications with Google, Gusto, Okta, One Login, and Rippling.
 Emergency Access Procedure
 Establish (and implement as needed) procedures for obtaining necessary electronic protected health information during an emergency.

Chunk 2807:
Content search provides Enterprise workspace owners with visibility into workspace content to improve governance of the workspace and resolve page access issues. Content search allows you to:
• Modify the permissions of a page
• Discover and re-assign abandoned pages from former employees You can export a Notion page, database, or entire workspace at any time.
 Automatic Logoff
 Implement electronic procedures that terminate an electronic session after a predetermined time of inactivity.

Chunk 2808:
Set custom session duration: For managed users on the Enterprise Plan, Notion has a default session duration of 180 days. However, workspace owners can customize their session duration from 1 hour to 180 days.Force logout managed users: Force logout for individual users or for all workspace users at once. Force password reset: Force password reset for individual users or for all workspace users at once.If you de-provision a user via SCIM, they will be removed from the workspace and their session will be terminated.
 Audit Controls
 Implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information.

Chunk 2809:
Enterprise workspace owners have access to an Audit Log via Settings. This gives an overview of a large range of events that have occurred in the workspace.
 This can be especially helpful for identifying potential security issues, investigating suspicious behavior, and troubleshooting access. The workspace audit log can be exported in CSV format.
 Enterprise customers can also utilize our Data Loss Prevention (DLP) partner integrations to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in Notion.
 Integrity Controls

Chunk 2810:
Implement policies and procedures to protect electronic protected health information from improper alteration or destruction.Implement electronic mechanisms to corroborate that electronic protected health information has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.Implement security measures to ensure that electronically transmitted electronic protected health information is not improperly modified without detection until disposed of.

Chunk 2811:
Disable public page sharing: This will disable the Share to web option in the Share menu on every page in this workspace.Disable guests: This prevents anyone from inviting people outside the workspace to any page. You don’t need to use this control if you’d like to invite guests as needed, but note that Notion may not be used to communicate with patients, plan members, or their families and employers. If you need to enable guests, we recommend turning on guest requests. This implements an approval process so that you can have guests in your workspace while ensuring HIPAA compliance.Disable moving or duplicating pages to other workspaces: This prevents anyone from moving or duplicating pages to other workspaces via the Move To or Duplicate action.Disable export: This prevents anyone from exporting as Markdown, CSV, or PDF.Disable workspace creation: This prevents anyone from creating new workspace(s) without approval.Disable or allowlist third party extensions: This prevents anyone from adding non-approved 3rd party extensions to your Notion workspace.Disable external workspace access: This prevents managed users from joining or accessing external workspace outside of your organization.

Chunk 2812:
Person or Entity Authentication
 Implement procedures to verify that a person or entity seeking access to electronic protected health information is the one claimed.

Chunk 2813:
Disable profile changes: This prevents managed users from changing their own profile information to avoid impersonations.Domain management: Domain refers to the email address domain associated with a Notion account. Domain verification allows workspace owners to claim ownership over a domain, which will unlock domain management settings.Disable guests: This prevents anyone from inviting people outside the workspace to any page. You don’t need to use this control if you’d like to invite guests as needed, but note that Notion may not be used to communicate with patients, plan members, or their families and employers. If you need to enable guests, we recommend turning on guest requests. This implements an approval process so that you can have guests in your workspace while ensuring HIPAA compliance.Suspend or delete a managed user account: Suspend or delete managed user accounts from the user management dashboard.Disable managed user account deletion: Prevent managed users from deleting their accounts on their own.

Chunk 2814:
Data Retention & Disposal
 Implement policies and procedures to address the final disposition of electronic PHI and/or the hardware or electronic media on which it is stored.
 Custom data retention settings allow Enterprise workspace owners to have control over when users’ pages are deleted from Trash, and how long they can be retained for afterwards.
 We keep backups of our database, which allows us to restore a snapshot of your content in the past 30 days if you need it.
 Transmission Security

Chunk 2815:
Implement technical security measures to guard against unauthorizedaccess to electronic protected health information that is being transmitted over an electronic communications network.Implement a mechanism to encrypt electronic protected health information whenever deemed appropriate.
 Encryption at rest: Customer data is encrypted at rest using AES-256. Customer data is encrypted when on Notion’s internal networks, at rest in Cloud storage, database tables, and backups.Encryption in transit: Data sent in-transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or greater.
 Note: Enterprise workspace owners are able to bypass by using an alternative login method in case there’s an Id P/SAML SSO failure.

FAQs
 What data do we process?
 Notion is committed to your safety and privacy. For detailed information on the data we process, please refer to our Data Processing Addendum.
 If we decide to leave Notion, what happens to our data?
 You can delete your data through two methods:

 Use the instructions on this help page.
 Sending an email to team@makenotion.com.

Chunk 2874:
If you accidentally deleted your data, please contact team@makenotion.com.
 For information around how long Notion will maintain data, please refer to the Data Processing Addendum.
 If there was a disaster with Notions Systems and my Notion Instance was impacted, how does Notion restore itself?
 Notion performs daily automated backups of all customer and system data to protect against loss due to unforeseen events across separate availability zones in AWS US West-2 and AWS US East-2.
 We have a dedicated Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan for these circumstances, and our Disaster Recovery Plan is tested at least annually to ensure Notion will recover from a disruption resulting from a disaster.

Chunk 2875:
Can Notion employees access our information?
 Notion employees will only ever access your data for the purposes of troubleshooting problems or recovering content on your behalf. Please refer to our Data Access Consent for further information.
 Will other people be able to see my pages?
 Your data is safe in Notion! If someone tries to navigate to your workspace without having access, they’ll see a page that lets them know that they do not have the correct permission state to access that content.
 If you enable Share to web in the Share menu at the top right of a page, it will publish that page to the web so that anyone with the link can access it. This is always turned off by default.

Chunk 2876:
If you’re sharing a workspace with others, some pages will be visible to everyone in the workspace, or specific groups of people — this is based on the permissions you see in the Share menu at the top right of the page.
 Please note, if you are using an account in an enterprise workspace, your content may be accessed by the workspace’s workspace owner. Learn more in our Personal Use Terms of Service.
 Can I opt out of Notion's tracking/analytics?
 Yes you can! This will also disable in-app message support, but you can still reach out to us for help at team@makenotion.com.
 Just send a message to our support team at that address and we'll opt you out.
 My browser alerted me that Notion is using trackers. What do these trackers do?

Chunk 2877:
We use tracking code in order to effectively run ads (for example, tracking a visit to our marketing site). We isolate this to a sandboxed iframe on a subdomain (aif.notion.so) — it's never activated on user pages.
 No user content is exposed to any third-party service.

 Notion maintains a comprehensive privacy compliance program and is committed to partnering with its customers and vendors on privacy compliance efforts. This page highlights some of the key aspects of our program.
How we handle your data

Chunk 2881:
At Notion, our team is dedicated to developing and implementing data privacy processes and safeguards that meet industry standards and best practices. We conduct ongoing training for our teams to ensure that they are up to speed with developments in legislation and essential privacy and security practices.
 Every Notion employee and contractor signs up to non-disclosure terms to maintain the confidentiality and security of your data. Notion also holds any vendors that handle personal data to the same data management, security, and privacy practices and standards to which we hold ourselves.
What is Customer Data?
 Notion defines Customer Data as any data that a customer stores in the Notion services. This can include personal information.

Chunk 2882:
Customer data does not include analytics data or Account Information, which we describe below. The terms of the Notion MSA and Notion DPA apply to your Customer Data.
What is Account Information?
 Account information is the information that our customers provide to us so that we can create and administer their customer accounts.
 For example, account information includes names, usernames, passwords, phone numbers, email addresses, Workspace metadata, support communications, billing information, and usage information associated with your Notion account.
 The terms of the Notion Privacy Policy apply to any personal information included in Account Information.
Who owns and controls Customer Data?

Chunk 2883:
You own your Customer Data, including any content you submit or upload to the Notion Service.
 You control your Customer Data. You determine what content and data will be uploaded to  Notion. Once Customer Data is uploaded you manage access to your workspace by allocating user logins to individuals.
 You also control the administration of the Customer Data by managing you groups, permissions and the user credentials that are under your control.
How does Notion use my Account Information?
 The Notion Privacy Policy describes in detail how Notion collects and uses your account information.
Who should I contact if I have any questions about Notion’s data protection practices?

Chunk 2884:
If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please contact us at:
 Notion Labs, Inc. 2300 Harrison Street San Francisco, CA 94110 United States privacy@makenotion.com
GDPR
 The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law that governs the collection of and use of personal data of EU residents, and that allows data subjects to exercise control over their data.
 As the GDPR is widely considered to be the most stringent global privacy standard, we have mapped our privacy program to the GDPR and other global privacy regulations.
Notion as Processor and Controller

Chunk 2885:
The GDPR and other data protection legislation have two primary classifications related to the collection and processing of personal data: data controller and data processor.
 A data controller determines the means and purposes for processing personal data, while a data processor is a party that processes data on behalf of the data controller.
 Where our customer is a data controller or data processor, Notion is the data processor of personal data that our customer and their users upload to the Notion service. We process any such personal data at our customer’s direction and on our customer’s behalf. We conduct this processing in accordance with Notion’s Data Processing Addendum.
Cross Border Transfers - Standard Contractual Clauses

Chunk 2886:
We understand and adhere to the rules for international transfers of personal data outside of the European Economic Area and UK.
 In order for our customers to be confident of Notion’s data transfer processes our Data Processing Addendum incorporates both the EU and UK Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). In response to the Schrems II ruling, our DPA lists the technical and organisational measures we employ to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place when we transfer personal data to countries outside of the EEA and UK.
 For more information about our technical security measures, please see our security page.
Transfer Impact Assessment

Chunk 2887:
Notion understands and appreciates the importance of maintaining transfer impact assessments (TIA) as a supplementary measure and as a critical piece of your privacy compliance program.
 To assist our customers in completing these assessments, we maintain Transfer Impact Assessment page that includes all of the information about Notion that you need to complete your TIA.
Subprocessor List
 We work with certain companies and tool systems to provide our services to you. All of these companies have been carefully vetted for best-in-class security and data privacy practices. For more information, please see our list of subprocessors.
Data Governance

Chunk 2888:
Data governance relates to the policies and procedures that dictate how data is procured and used throughout its life cycle. From creation and collection to processing, distribution, storage and deletion.
 Notion’s commitment to data governance is key to keeping our users data secure, private, accurate, and accessible.
Privacy by Design
 At Notion, we believe in privacy by design, which means that privacy considerations are built into every aspect of our products and services from the outset. This includes the development of new products, features, and the selection of vendors.
 Notion conducts regular training with our personnel to reinforce the concept that Notion needs to think of user privacy at all stages of the development lifecycle.

Chunk 2889:
Data Export
 Companies generally have a duty to back up their information in multiple places. To help with this Notion offers the option to save any Notion page, database, and non-database page to your computer in various formats. This way our customers can further protect themselves by backing up their information at any time.
Data Import
 Notion’s data import function lets you upload information from external sources and combine it with the data already held in your workspace.
 Like most people, you probably have data, documents, and notes scattered across many files and apps. You can centralize your information in one place by moving it all into Notion.
Data Deletion

Chunk 2890:
The workspace owner controls the workspace’s Customer Data. This includes all of the content submitted by customers and their users. When users leave a workspace, they may have the right to request that their data is deleted by the workspace owner. When customers terminate their subscription they also have the right to request that their data be deleted by Notion.
 Notion allows for Account Deletion and Workspace Deletion.
 When you delete an account, Notion will:
• Delete any private workspace(s) in which you are the only member
• Delete any shared workspace(s) in which you are the only admin
• Remove you from any shared workspace(s) in which you are a member or one of multiple admins

Chunk 2891:
Delete the account associated with that email address
 Delete any private workspace(s) in which you are the only member
 Delete any shared workspace(s) in which you are the only admin
 Remove you from any shared workspace(s) in which you are a member or one of multiple admins
 To delete a workspace, you must be a workspace owner of that workspace. When you delete a workspace, Notion will:
• Return you to another workspace you belong to, or the sign up page for Notion if you don't belong to any others
 Delete all content in that workspace
 Return you to another workspace you belong to, or the sign up page for Notion if you don't belong to any others

Chunk 2892:
To learn more about how to delete your Notion account please see our Delete Your Account page. If you are a Customer and would like to terminate your contract, please see our MSA.
Data Access
 Notion provides an advanced set of access functionality to help customers effectively protect their information. Notion also uses encryption to protect Customer Data from outside access.To learn more about how data access works at Notion please see our Data Access Consent page.
Data Backup

Chunk 2893:
All Customer Data is stored in the cloud, and we keep per-minute backups of your page content on our server. That said, your data belongs to you, so we've made it easy to create your own backups and keep your information portable. To learn more about this please see Notion’s Back up your Data page.
Agreements
 At Notion we strive to keep all of our agreements up to date with the latest regulations and industry standards. Our Master Subscription Agreement and Data Processing Addendum describe in detail Notion’s data privacy processes, standards, safeguards and our compliance with data protection legislation.

Chunk 2894:
To ensure that our terms track with the GDPR, CCPA and other global privacy standards we continually have our terms assessed by leading privacy experts in multiple jurisdictions.
Policies
 At Notion we want to be as transparent as possible with our customers about how we collect, process, store, and use their personal data. In order to achieve this Notion maintains comprehensive and detailed policies regarding how we handle your personal information. These policies describe in detail how our users can exercise their rights with regard to their data. To learn more about the policies, please click on the links below.

Chunk 2928:
The U.S. government has introduced restrictions prohibiting access to certain software products and services to any person in Russia. Due to these restrictions, on September 9, 2024, Notion will no longer provide users located in Russia access to the platform. This includes:
• Preventing users from accessing Notion’s services while in Russia. Users in workspaces that have never had billing associated with Russia will be able to regain access to Notion once outside Russia.

Chunk 2929:
• If any billing information connected with the workspace is currently or was previously associated with Russia, the workspace will be terminated. This is necessary for compliance with sanctions, and updating an account’s billing information will not change the restriction.
• Terminating subscription payments for all plans identified as having any billing information associated with Russia, historical or current.

Malvertising is a cyber threat that puts your data at risk using malicious software. Make sure to download Notion only from trusted sources, and read on to learn how you can stay safe from malvertising 🛡️

Chunk 2940:
• How does malvertising affect you?
• Protect yourself from malvertising
 At Notion, we prioritize the safety and trust of our users. As part of this commitment, we share tips on online safety. One key area of focus is combating "Malvertising", a common cyber threat where online ads are used to distribute malicious software.
 Malvertising is a method where cybercriminals misuse online advertising platforms to distribute malware. They accomplish this by creating ads that mimic trusted brands, such as Notion, and deceiving users into downloading their malicious software.
How does malvertising affect you?

Chunk 2941:
If you accidentally download and install malware thinking it's the official Notion app, your device and personal data may be at risk. This could lead to your account being compromised, personal information getting exposed, and potential data loss.
Protect yourself from malvertising
 Download apps from trusted sources: Only download the Notion app from the App Store, Google Play Store, or Notion’s website. Avoid third-party app stores or ad links.
 Exercise caution with online ads: Avoid clicking on ads that seem suspicious or overly enticing. It's safer to ignore ads that are unfamiliar or seem unusual.

Chunk 2942:
Keep your software up-to-date: Regularly update your device's operating system and apps. These updates often include security enhancements that guard against known vulnerabilities, which could be exploited by malware.
 Use security software: Install trusted security software on your device. Ensure it's always up-to-date and perform regular malware scans.
 Stay informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest cyber threats and effective protection strategies. Knowledge is your strongest defense in cybersecurity. There are various ways to keep yourself informed. Here’s a list of some excellent sources.

Chunk 2943:
Remember, if you land on a Notion download page, verify it is notion.so/download. If you encounter any activity that seems suspicious and involves Notion, please report it to us via security@makenotion.com.
 Your safety and trust are our top priorities. We continually strive to protect our brand and users from threats. By staying alert and following these steps, you can contribute to this protective effort.

 To add Notion AI to your plan, you’ll need to be a workspace owner, and on desktop.
 Click on Settings in your sidebar.

 Next to Notion AI, click Add to plan.
 Learn more about Notion AI billing and payments here →

Chunk 2967:
Note: The AI add-on is not available for users on the i OS Personal Pro Plan. To purchase Notion AI, you'll need to cancel your in-app subscription and choose a new Notion plan. We recommend the Plus Plan, which allows for unlimited blocks for teams, 30-day page history, and up to 100 guests.Notion is not able to provide a refund for the remaining time on your in-app subscription, but you can reach out to Apple for assistance — just follow the instructions here.
Complimentary AI responses

Chunk 2968:
Everyone can try Notion AI for free before purchasing the add-on subscription. The more members you have, the more complimentary AI responses you may get, with the maximum being 500 responses across your entire workspace. To see how many free AI responses are remaining, workspace owners can go to Settings on desktop.
 Once you've used all your complimentary AI responses, you will see a message that a Notion AI add-on subscription is necessary to continue using AI features. You’ll need to be a workspace owner, and on desktop, to add Notion AI to your plan.
What counts as an AI response?

Chunk 2969:
Every time you take an AI action (including creating new content, editing existing content, using AI blocks, adding an autofill property, asking a question, etc.) and receive a response from Notion AI, that counts as an AI response.
 Anytime you click Try again, that counts as an additional AI response.

• FAQs

Chunk 2990:
Note: While Notion AI connectors are available at no additional cost to existing Notion AI users on paid plans at this time, pricing is subject to change.
What are Notion AI connectors?
 Today, Notion AI enables you to ask any questions about the content in your Notion workspace. With Notion AI connectors, when you ask a question, Notion AI will also surface relevant information from your connected apps, citing specific sources it referenced. Notion AI connectors are currently in beta and subject to the beta provisions in your agreement, if any.

Chunk 2991:
To start, we’re integrating Notion AI with Slack and Google Drive, with other apps coming soon. You can set up Notion AI connectors by opening Notion AI at the bottom of your screen and clicking on
•
•
• → Connect Slack or Connect Google Drive.
 Try asking Notion AI "How do I run a hot fix?" or "Can you find me the action items from this thread?” with a link to a particular Slack conversation.
FAQs
 Why connect third-party apps with Notion AI?
 Notion AI enables you to ask any questions about the content in your Notion workspace. When you choose to connect third-party apps like Slack, Notion AI will also surface relevant information from those third-party data sources you enable, citing the specific messages it referenced.

Chunk 2992:
Notion’s collection of AI products and features like third-party connections to Notion AI appear seamlessly in your workspace but leverage technology from several AI Subprocessors. Notion AI connectors are currently in beta and subject to the beta provisions of your agreement. Read our Notion AI security and privacy practices for more information, as well as our list of subprocessors. Our goal is to protect your data and workspaces while allowing you to be more effective in your organizations.
 Will my data be used to train Notion’s models?

Chunk 2993:
No. We only process your Customer Data to provide the functionality. We do not process your Customer Data to train our models and do not allow our sub-processors to process your Customer Data to train their models. View our terms and privacy pages for more information.
 Are existing permissions respected when using Notion AI connectors beta?
 Users will only be able to access third-party content that they had access to in the third-party service. Notion AI will not be able to answer users’ questions based on data and content to which they do not have access. Notion AI manages third-party content (e.g., Slack) with security in mind, adhering to user permissions based both on the third-party application as well as in Notion AI.

Chunk 3000:
If you’re a Slack workspace admin, you’ll be able to select the Slack workspace and channels you want to connect. You can select All public channels or specific public channels. You also have the option to include public channels created in the future. This won’t include public channels containing external users, like Slack Connect channels. You also won’t be able to connect any private channels or private DMs.
• If you’re not a Slack workspace admin, you can request this integration. Your Slack workspace admin or approved Slack members will be notified. Once your request is approved, you can choose the Slack channels you want to connect. Make sure you’re requesting the integration for the right Notion workspace!

Chunk 3001:
If you’re not a Slack workspace admin, you can request this integration. Your Slack workspace admin or approved Slack members will be notified. Once your request is approved, you can choose the Slack channels you want to connect. Make sure you’re requesting the integration for the right Notion workspace!
 Once Notion AI has joined those public channels, a message will be sent in those public channels to say Notion AI has joined them and will join all future public channels. This message won’t show up in Slack channels with external users.

Chunk 3002:
Once the integration is set up, it will be able to find messages going back a year from when the setup is complete. For example, if you connect Slack with Notion AI on June 1, 2024, Notion AI will be able to find information from messages in Slack sent on June 1, 2023 and later.
 This process can take up to 36 hours. You’ll see this communicated in your Notion AI chat, and the message will disappear when the integration is complete.
Which Slack channels can be connected to Notion AI?
 When you connect Slack to Notion AI, you have the option to select specific public Slack channels you’d like to connect. Alternatively, you can choose to connect all public channels, including ones that are created in the future.

Chunk 3003:
These public channels will not include any Slack Connect channels that you use to communicate with external partners.
 At this time, you also can’t connect private Slack DMs and private Slack channels to Notion AI.
FAQs
 How long does it take for the integration to complete for public channels?
 Once the integration is set up, it will be able to find messages going back a year from when the setup is complete. For example, if you connect Slack with Notion AI on June 1, 2024, Notion AI will be able to find information from messages in Slack sent on June 1, 2023 and later. Depending on the amount of content shared in your public channels during this time frame, this process can take up to 36 hours.

Chunk 3004:
How long does it take for Notion AI to read new Slack messages?
 New messages in public channels may take 30 minutes to be searchable by Notion AI.
 Can I limit the scope of my search to only Slack or only Notion?
 Yes! In the Notion AI entry point, click Find in to toggle between Everything you can access, Notion, and Slack.
 If I connect Slack to Notion AI, does Notion AI automatically begin searching all of my Slack channels?

Chunk 3005:
No. Notion AI only searches public Slack channels, and during initial setup, our configuration options allow you to choose either a discrete set of public channels or all public channels in your workspace to be included. Additionally, you have the option to continuously include all public channels that are created after initial setup. This configuration requires approvals via the Notion workspace owner and the Slack admin.
 Who can access Slack content using Notion AI?

Chunk 3006:
Individuals who are both a Slack and a Notion workspace member can use this integration. Notion AI maps Slack members to Notion members, so individuals must be authenticated at the user level for its use. Through account mapping and real-time event subscriptions, Notion conducts ongoing checks for changes to permissions and access levels that would impact the Slack content surfaced in Notion AI for each individual. This integration is not available for guests in your Notion workspace, or guests in your Slack workspace (like people external to your organization that you may communicate with using Slack Connect).
 Here are a few examples of permissions-related scenarios that Notion proactively checks and updates for:

Chunk 3007:
• When users edit or delete a message in Slack, Notion AI monitors for modified or deleted content via webhooks and will reflect these updates in near real-time.
• Slack or Notion guest users are not allowed to leverage Notion AI at all. In the case where a guest user is given full Slack workspace member and full Notion workspace member permissions, Notion AI monitor for membership changes and updates those permissions changes in near-real time.
• When a user is deactivated in Slack, Notion AI monitors permissions and updates that permission change within approximately 30 minutes.
 When users edit or delete a message in Slack, Notion AI monitors for modified or deleted content via webhooks and will reflect these updates in near real-time.

Chunk 3008:
Slack or Notion guest users are not allowed to leverage Notion AI at all. In the case where a guest user is given full Slack workspace member and full Notion workspace member permissions, Notion AI monitor for membership changes and updates those permissions changes in near-real time.
 When a user is deactivated in Slack, Notion AI monitors permissions and updates that permission change within approximately 30 minutes.
 I have Slack Connect channels set up with external users. Will these channels be indexed?
 No. All external messages and channels will be excluded.
 How does Notion store or reference my Slack data in its systems?

Chunk 3009:
Slack content is stored as embeddings using vector databases like Pinecone. These embeddings allow for efficient searches and comparisons across different pieces of text to provide accurate and relevant responses to your questions.
 Notion’s vector databases have been vetted by our Security team as well as by an external auditor to obtain their SOC2 Type II certification. See this article for more information.
 How much of my Slack data will be ingested for Notion AI?

Chunk 3010:
Once the integration is set up, it will be able to find messages going back a year from when the setup is complete. For example, if you connect Slack with Notion AI on June 1, 2024, Notion AI will be able to find information from messages in Slack sent on June 1, 2023 and later. The feature will also continue to ingest any new messages added to your Slack environment (in either your selected channels or all public channels) after initial configuration to be used for responses to search queries.
 I connected the wrong Notion workspace. How can I disconnect my Slack workspace from Notion?
 To disconnect your Slack workspace, open Notion AI at the bottom of your screen and click on
•
•
• → Connect Slack → Settings → Disconnect.

Chunk 3011:
What happens to my Slack data if I connect to Notion AI and then decide to disconnect?
 Notion treats your Slack content with the privacy principle of data minimization in mind. If you decide to disconnect your Slack environment from Notion AI, your Slack content will immediately become unsearchable, and your Slack data used for Notion AI will be deleted in less than one day from when the request is made.

FAQs
 What does Notion AI have access to?
 Notion AI will only have access to a file if both conditions are satisfied:

Chunk 3019:

 Can I limit what Notion AI has access to?

Chunk 3020:
Yes, you can limit what Notion AI has access to by either selecting shared drives or user groups and organizational units.
• Shared drives: In Notion, an admin will have the option to omit specific shared drives in Settings.
• User groups and organizational units: For granular permissions, the admin has the option to select specific user groups or organizational units in the Google Admin Workspace. For any user groups or organizational units that are deselected, Notion will not ingest any files that are owned by this audience and this audience will not be able to use the feature in Notion.

• Restricted: Only users who have been directly added to the document will have access
• {Company Name}: Anyone in the company can access the document as long as any user in the workspace has visited the page.
• Anyone with link: Anyone in the company can access the document if they have visited the document at least once. In the document, the access level should be set to Can find in search results and not Must have link to access, which is the default setting.

 Anyone with link: Anyone in the company can access the document if they have visited the document at least once. In the document, the access level should be set to
 Can find in search results and not Must have link to access, which is the default setting.

 How long does it take for new content to appear?
 New content added to Google documents will update every hour and will be available in searches then in Notion AI.
 Will all future content or shared/user drives be available?

Chunk 3025:

 Can I add connect multiple Notion workspaces to my Google Workspace?
 Not at this time. The workspace admin will only be able to connect one Notion workspace to one Google Workspace.
 Does Notion AI respect Google Drive permissions?

Chunk 3026:
Absolutely. Notion AI will honor existing permissions according to our existing Notion AI Security Practices. Users will not be able to generate content or receive responses based on resources they do not have access to. Specific to third party content, Notion AI is handling both private and public content with security in mind, only ingesting content according to the permissions mapping between what Google Drive and Notion users.
 How do shared drives work?
 If a shared drive lives outside your Google Workspace, Notion AI will not be able to access or retrieve the information in it.

Chunk 3027:
If a shared drive is in your connected Google Workspace, we will respect the permission settings of the Drive (if the shared drive was directly shared with you) or the file  (the file has been shared directly with you or with a group that you are a part of).
 How does Notion store or reference my Google Drive data in its systems?
 Similar to our core Notion AI product, we store create and store embeddings in a vector database hosted by Pinecone, which powers the ability to provide responses to questions that leverage third party content (like in Google Drive). Pinecone has been vetted by our security team as well as an external auditor to obtain their SOC2 Type II certification. Learn more about Pinecone’s security here →

Chunk 3028:
Which account should I use to initiate the connection for Google Drive in Notion?
 Whichever account is used to initiate connection will be stored in the Notion system as a customer admin email, and we will use this admin email for future updates, so it's important for customers to provide an email that won't change in terms of permissions or active status so that service isn't impacted when, for example, an admin leaves the company. You can use any service email that has admin privileges to your Google Workspace and will remain the same, like admin-svc@company.com.

 Get answers from your Notion workspace and connected apps
 Generate docs and edit your writing
 Analyze PDFs and images
 Chat about anything, using AI knowledge from models like GPT-4 and Claude

Chunk 3034:
Autofill summaries and insights across entire databases
 Notion AI appears seamlessly in your workspace but leverages technology from several AI Subprocessors to provide you with the service. Check out our Subprocessor Page for a complete list of our current Subprocessors, and learn more about Notion AI here →
How does Notion AI work?
Who are Notion’s Large Language Model Providers?
 Notion currently utilizes various large language models (LLMs) hosted by Notion as well as by organizations such as Anthropic and Open AI. We continuously evaluate LLM providers and their models to provide the highest quality experience to our Notion AI users. Any third parties that process Customer Data will be published in our Subprocessor Page.

Chunk 3035:
How do I subscribe to new Subprocessor notifications?
 Customers may sign up to receive notification of new Subprocessors by emailing team@makenotion.com with the subject “Subscribe to New Subprocessors.” Once a customer has signed up to receive new Subprocessor notifications, Notion will provide that customer with notice of any new Subprocessors before authorizing the new Subprocessor to process Customer Data. For additional information, please see our Data Processing Addendum.
How does Notion AI use content from a workspace?
 Notion AI is able to reference content from your workspace through two key phases:
 Generating an embedding (i.e., a semantic representation of the information stored in your workspace).

Chunk 3036:
Generating responses informed by the content in your workspace.
 What are embeddings?
 Embeddings are numerical representations of text or documents. These representations capture the meaning and context of the text in a multidimensional space, where similar topics have similar numerical representations. By using embeddings, vector search algorithms can efficiently compare and find similarities between different pieces of text or documents. For Notion AI, embeddings are created from workspace content to enable the system to provide accurate and relevant responses to user questions.
 Here is an example of an embedding from Open AI:
 [  -0.02541878,  -0.0104167685,  -0.0015037002,  ...,  -0.004155378,  -0.00043069973,  -0.01679479]

Chunk 3037:
How are embeddings created?
 For each page in your workspace, we generate an embedding by using an Open AI zero-retention embeddings API.
 Notion receives an embedding for each Notion page and stores it in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone). The vector database is a data store optimized for embeddings that enables fast lookup of the most relevant pages given a user request.
 How are embeddings protected?

Chunk 3038:
Despite embeddings only being a numerical representation of Customer Data, Notion still treats embeddings with the same level of security and privacy considerations as Customer Data. All our Customer Data commitments outlined in our Master Service Agreement (MSA) and Data Processing Agreement (DPA) apply to embeddings. View our Terms and Privacy Page for more information.
 We store embeddings with vector databases like Pinecone. These vector databases have been vetted by our security team as well as an external auditor to obtain their SOC 2 Type 2 certification.
How are responses generated?
 Notion receives a request from a user.

Chunk 3039:
The request is passed to LLMs and AI Models. If the request does not require searching the Notion workspace, a response is generated at this point and returned. If the user’s request requires searching their workspace, LLMs and AI Models generate a search query most relevant for the user request.
 The query is passed to a vector database, where a list of pages is found based on relevance to that query.
 Notion sends the query — and the pages identified by the vector database — to LLMs and AI Models where the pages are refined and ranked by relevance to the query.
 The query, refined list of pages, and ranking of pages are processed by the LLMs and AI Models to generate a response that fulfills the user’s request.

Chunk 3040:
Notion processes the output to adhere to the right format and language and displays the output to the user.
How is my data protected?
Does Notion AI respect existing permissions?
 Yes, Notion AI honors existing permissions. The LLMs and AI Models used to generate AI responses for a user cannot see or use any information to which that user does not already have access.
How is Customer Data protected when sent to AI Subprocessors?
 Notion AI is designed to protect your Customer Data and prevent information leaks to other users of the service.

Chunk 3041:
Prior to engaging any third-party Subprocessor or vendor, Notion evaluates their privacy, security, and confidentiality practices, and executes an agreement implementing its applicable security, privacy, and legal obligations. All Subprocessors are monitored and reviewed at least annually to ensure continued compliance with Notion’s security and privacy expectations. This includes reviewing documents such as attestation reports, penetration tests, and other artifacts based on the Subprocessor’s criticality and other risk factors. As part of the onboarding and ongoing reviews, technology security questionnaires are distributed to vendors and are required to be completed. Significant public security events are also assessed to protect the supply chain attack surface.

Chunk 3042:
When we send your Customer Data to third parties, it is encrypted in-transit using TLS 1.2 or greater.
 For more information about how Notion processes your data, please refer to our Data Processing Addendum.
Will my data be used to train any models?
 By default, Notion and its AI Subprocessors do not use Customer Data to train any models. We specifically have contractual agreements in place with our AI Subprocessors that prohibit the use of Customer Data to train their models.
 Your use of Notion AI does not grant Notion any right or license to your Customer Data to train our machine learning models.
How is Customer Data segregated?

Chunk 3043:
Individual customer accounts are kept separate in our production environment. We do not mix or process data from different customers together during AI processing. This means we do not expose your data to other Notion customers.
What are the data retention obligations of third-party AI providers?
 Notion AI Subprocessors have data retention policies that allow Notion to meet our obligations to customers for the processing of data.
 When using Notion AI, our LLM Subprocessors only retain Customer Data for 30 days or fewer before deletion. Notion AI is additionally powered by Open AI's embeddings. Open AI does not retain any Customer Data through their embeddings service.

Chunk 3044:
Embeddings stored in vector databases are deleted within 60 days from when the page or workspace is deleted.
 If a user deletes a Notion page or Notion workspace, we can restore the content within 30 days. After 30 days, the data is deleted and unrecoverable. This includes any AI-generated data and embeddings. For more information about deleting or restoring your data, please refer to this article.
What compliance standards does Notion AI meet?
 Notion AI is included in the scope of Notion’s SOC 2 Type 2 report and ISO 27001 certification, demonstrating our commitment to various regulatory and industry standards.

Chunk 3045:
We are actively working to enable Notion AI to meet HIPAA requirements by utilizing LLM provider’s zero-retention APIs and allow for the processing of protected health information (PHI).
What controls can be added?
Can data loss prevention (DLP) be configured to alert for data being used by Notion AI?
 Customers can trigger data loss prevention (DLP) alerts for sensitive content in their Notion workspace using third-party integration partners on our Enterprise Plan. That will include content in an AI prompt and the content generated by AI. Learn more about our DLP integrations here.
What are the legal considerations?
Are there rules against what I can do with Notion AI?

Chunk 3046:
The Notion AI Supplementary Terms apply to your usage of Notion AI. In addition, Notion’s Content & Use Policy applies to any content on Notion, including content generated by Notion AI. Violating these terms can result in removal of your content or suspension of access to your workspace.
Who owns the rights to content generated by Notion AI?
 Notion does not claim ownership of your input or the generated output. This is addressed in the Notion AI Supplementary Terms in the "Input and Output" section:
 You may provide input to be processed by Notion AI (“Input”), and receive output generated and returned by Notion AI based on the Input (“Output”). When you use Notion AI, Input and Output are your Customer Data.

Chunk 3047:
You can also reference our standard data protection practices.

Create a Notion Calendar account with Google
 You’ll need a Google account to use Notion Calendar. Once you’ve downloaded the Notion Calendar app, create an account using your Google credentials.
 Note: We know you may want to connect calendars other than Google Calendar. We’re working on adding support for other calendar apps — check https://www.notion.so/releases and https://twitter.com/notioncalendar for updates.
 If you’re a Google Workspace admin and you want to restrict access to Notion Calendar or learn more about our security practices, read this article →
Giving Notion Calendar permission to access your Google account

Chunk 3058:
Notion Calendar asks only for the Google permissions that we absolutely need to make sure Notion Calendar works properly. These permissions are only used to access data on your behalf, never to read, edit, or delete it without direct action from you. Notion Calendar is verified by Google and can’t access any user data categorized as restricted. We’ll never see your Google password. You also have the ability to remove access at any time. Learn more about how we protect your data here →
 Here are the permissions we require to run Notion Calendar effectively. Once you give these permissions at first login, you won’t have to do it again.

Chunk 3059:
If you don’t grant some of these permissions while you’re setting up, you might not see all your events and contacts in Notion Calendar. Don’t worry — to go back and update this, select your avatar in Notion Calendar → Log out → Sign in with Google.
Troubleshoot login issues
 If you’re told you’re not a Notion Calendar user when signing in with Google, make sure you’ve signed in with the Google account you used to create your Notion Calendar account. If you have multiple Google accounts, you can add them and pick a primary Google account in Notion Calendar settings once you’re successfully logged in.

Chunk 3060:
If you’re told something went wrong when signing in with Google, try signing in again in a different browser. You can also select Sign into another account and try again with the same credentials.
 If you get an authorization error when signing in with Google with a work email, it might be because an admin hasn’t approved Notion Calendar to be authorized with Google at your organization yet. To fix this issue, admins can:
• Sign into admin.google.com with their admin credentials.
• Go to Security → Access and data control → API controls → Manage Google services.
• Under Configured apps, select View list → Add app → OAuth app Name or Client ID.
• Find and select Notion Calendar, and from the app access options, choose Trusted.

 If you’re on mobile, select + at the bottom right of the app, then enter details for your event. To finish, select Done, or Send invite if you’ve added other participants.

Chunk 3070:
Note: Only certain types of Google accounts can be used to create Focus events. Learn more here →
 Create multiple-day events with start and end times
 To create multiple-day events with time details, select a time slot in your calendar, then drag it across the days the event will span. Once the event is created, you can enter start and end times for it.
 Note: You can use headers, hyperlinks, numbered and bulleted lists, and more in your event description.
RSVP to events
 To respond to a calendar invite, right-click the event on desktop or select the event on mobile, then select your RSVP status.

Chunk 3071:
If you’re the event organizer, your RSVP status will automatically be Yes. To change your status, select the arrows next to your name in the event details on desktop. On mobile, select the event, then select a new RSVP status.
 You can also add a note after you’ve RSVPed to an event. To do this, select an event, then select ✏️ next to the RSVP options. Enter your note in the text field. Once you’re done, select Send update to share the note with other participants via email. If you don’t want an email to be sent, open the dropdown next to Send update and select Send update without email.
 Select an event to see any RSVP notes for it.

Chunk 3072:
If the same event shows up on more than one of your calendars — that is, if they share the same event ID — Notion Calendar will merge those events automatically. If an event has been auto-merged and you want to RSVP from a specific calendar, hide your other calendars and RSVP from the calendar that’s visible.
Change an event's location
 To add or remove the location for an event, select the event and edit the Location field in the right context panel.
Change your status and event privacy
 Select an event. Then, in the right context panel, show your status as Busy or Free. You can also make your event’s details visible to others by making them Public, or only to yourself and other participants by making them Private.

Chunk 3073:
Change your event type
 In Notion Calendar, there are three kinds of events: Event, Focus time, or Out of office. You can change your event type at any time using Notion Calendar on desktop or web. To change your event type, click on the event, open the dropdown next to the event type, and choose your desired event type.
 Note: At this time, Focus and OOO events are only available to Notion Calendar users with work or school accounts managed by Google Workspace.
Email participants
 Select an event, then select
•
•
• at the top right of the right context panel → Email participants. This will open a mailto: link.
 On Mac, this defaults to the Mail app. To change this:

Turn on Scheduling link to generate a link that your invitees can go to to confirm when they’d like to meet with you. When turned on, this link will be included in your scheduling snippet. You can also select
•
•
• → Copy scheduling link to quickly send it to someone. When your invitees visit your link, they’ll see your snippet along with your availability. They can choose a time slot that works for them. Then, your meeting with them will automatically appear on your calendar, and any unnecessary calendar holds will be released.
 Note: At this time, it’s not possible to:
• Indicate or take into account the availabilities of people other than yourself.
• Change the content of your snippet.

Chunk 3086:
• Create multiple or repeat bookings using the same scheduling link.
 Indicate or take into account the availabilities of people other than yourself.

Blocking

Chunk 3087:
Have a doctor’s appointment that you don’t want a teammate to schedule over? Notion Calendar’s blocking features make it easy to block events across your various calendars. For example, Notion Calendar can put a block on your work calendar for an event you have on your personal calendar, so people know you’re busy without being able to see your personal commitments. You can block single events or auto-block whole calendars.
Block an event or an entire calendar
 On desktop or web:
 Right-click an event and select Block on calendar.
 Select the calendar you want to create a block in.

Chunk 3088:
To create a block for a single event, select This event. Alternatively, you can select All events from {calendar name} to set up auto-blocking. For example, if you are creating a block on your work calendar for an event on your personal calendar, you can synchronize the two calendars so that all future events from your personal calendar will be blocked on your work calendar.
 Choose to Include details from the original calendar event in the block, or simply Show as busy. This will apply to future blocks if you choose to auto-block.

Chunk 3089:
To see what details you’ve shared on a calendar block, right-click the original event and select Block on calendar. There will be a 🔒 next to the calendar where the block was set up — if the lock is open, that means the event’s details have been shared. If the lock is closed, that means the event’s details are hidden.
 Alternatively, you can hide the original calendar from view by selecting the eye icon next to its name in the left sidebar. Then, you can find the block on your other calendar and see its details.
Remove blocking
 You can remove blocks the same way you created them. Right-click a blocked event and unselect the calendar where the block lives. You can unblock a single event, or turn off auto-blocking by unblocking all events.

Chunk 3090:
You may want to undo auto-blocking for a calendar that you no longer have access to. We’re working to improve this experience, but in the meantime you can reach out to team@makenotion.com.
Time zones
 In Notion Calendar, time zones are first-class citizens. You can add multiple time zones to your calendar, give them custom labels, and even temporarily travel to time zones.
Primary time zone
 Note: When you set up Notion Calendar for the first time, we get your primary time zone from Google Calendar. After that, any changes you make to your time zones in Notion Calendar won’t be reflected in Google Calendar, and vice versa.

Chunk 3091:
Events on your calendar are displayed in your primary time zone. This time zone is displayed directly to the left of your calendar.
Add a time zone
 Use the keyboard shortcut cmd/ctrl + K and enter “time zone” for quick access to time zone features.
 Any new time zones you display on your calendar are secondary time zones. To add a time zone, select + next to your primary time zone. Select your desired time zone from the list that appears. This time zone will appear next to your other time zones.
 If you’re on mobile, select the time zone on the very left of your calendar, then select Add time zone.
 If you want to have more than four total time zones shown in your calendar, follow the instructions here →
Edit or remove a time zone

Chunk 3092:
Right-click a time zone, then:
 Select Change to replace it with another time zone.
 Select Rename to give your time zone another name.
 Select Make time zone primary. This will bring this time zone closest to your calendar, and move any other time zones to the left.
 Select Remove time zone from list.
Reorder your time zones
 On desktop, you can rearrange your time zones by selecting and dragging them. The right-most time zone will become your primary time zone.
Travel to a time zone

Chunk 3093:
Use the keyboard shortcut Z to travel to a new time zone. This time zone will temporarily become your primary time zone. You can permanently add this time zone to your calendar by right-clicking on it and selecting Add as primary time zone or Add as secondary time zone.
Update time zones on mobile
 To make changes to time zones on Notion Calendar for mobile, select a time zone, then select Make time zone secondary, Make time zone primary, Add time zone, or Remove time zone.

Conferencing integrations
 For the best experience with setting up conferencing integrations and adding conferencing links to events, use Notion Calendar on desktop or web.
 Notion Calendar integrates with conferencing tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and many more. There are three types of conferencing integrations in Notion Calendar:
• Default integrations: Conferencing that is available to you by default from your calendar provider. Google Meet, which is linked to Google Calendar, is one example.

Chunk 3118:
• Connected integrations: An integration you can set up by logging into a conferencing tool. New events you create on desktop or web will generate new links for this conference tool from within Notion Calendar. Zoom is an example of a connected integration that Notion Calendar supports.
• Custom integrations: You can add a stable conferencing link for a conferencing tool of your choice by going to Settings → Conferencing → Conferencing providers → Add. You can give your integration a name. This conferencing tool will show up in the conferencing dropdown when you create events. Any stable links will work, but Notion Calendar can detect popular services, including Around, Blue Jeans, Doxy.me, Microsoft Teams, Skype, Webex, and Whereby.

Chunk 3119:

Any stable links will work, but Notion Calendar can detect popular services, including Around, Blue Jeans, Doxy.me, Microsoft Teams, Skype, Webex, and Whereby.
 Note: If an event contains conferencing links in both its description and conferencing field, you’ll be taken to the link from the event’s description when you join a meeting from Notion Calendar.
Set a default conferencing option

Chunk 3121:
A default conferencing option allows you to automatically add conferencing to an event that has at least one other participant when you’re using Notion Calendar on desktop. To set Zoom as this default option, go to Settings → Conferencing → Default conferencing, then in the dropdown, select Zoom.
Zoom
 Connect your Zoom account
 To connect your Zoom and Notion Calendar accounts, go to Settings → Conferencing. Find Zoom and select Configure. When you’re redirected to your browser, make sure you’re logged in with the right Zoom account, then select Authorize to give Notion Calendar access.

Chunk 3122:
Notion Calendar asks only for the Zoom permissions that we absolutely need to make sure the integration with Notion Calendar works properly. These permissions are only used to allow you to connect your account and add Zoom meetings to events. Learn more about our security practices here →
 Passcode settings

Chunk 3123:
If you’ve enabled the use of Personal Meeting IDs (PMIs) in your Zoom Profile Settings, Notion Calendar will use your configured stable PMI and passcode when adding a Zoom link to a meeting. If this setting is off in Zoom, Notion Calendar will protect your Zoom calls with a secure, one-time PIN and include it in the meeting for you and participants to join with a single click. Notion Calendar generates these PINs according to your Zoom admin's passcode complexity requirements.
 Disconnect your Zoom account
 To stop using your Zoom account with Notion Calendar, go to Settings → Conferencing. Find Zoom and select Disconnect.

Chunk 3124:
If you remove Notion Calendar from your installed apps in Zoom App Marketplace, we will follow Zoom's deauthorization and data compliance guidelines.
 Note:
• If you’re having trouble authorizing Notion Calendar as you set up the integration, have an admin sign into marketplace.zoom.us, search for Notion Calendar, and turn on Pre-approve.
• Currently, when you join a meeting in the Zoom app from Notion Calendar, your video will be turned off by default.
• If you have any problems joining a meeting, try disconnecting then reconnecting your Zoom account.
 If you’re having trouble authorizing Notion Calendar as you set up the integration, have an admin sign into marketplace.zoom.us, search for Notion Calendar, and turn on Pre-approve.

Chunk 3125:
Currently, when you join a meeting in the Zoom app from Notion Calendar, your video will be turned off by default.
 If you have any problems joining a meeting, try disconnecting then reconnecting your Zoom account.
Google Meet
 Because Notion Calendar is already connected to your Google account, you don’t need to do anything else to add Google Meet links to your meetings! Even if you’ve connected multiple Google accounts to Notion Calendar, Notion Calendar will make sure you’re joining meetings across your various calendars from the right Google account.

Chunk 3126:
Note: If you don’t see Google Meet as a conferencing option in Notion Calendar, it might mean your Google Workspace doesn’t have Google Meet enabled. Reach out to an admin to turn on Meet video calling.
Notion integration
 Notion Calendar can be used with Notion. Add Notion pages to your event details for easy access and view important dates from Notion databases directly in Notion Calendar so you don’t have to track your database events separately from your other important plans. Learn more here →
Notion Calendar API
 Notion Calendar has a simple local API you can use to open Notion Calendar to a specific event from another tool. This works on desktop, on both mac OS and Windows.
 Here is an example schema:

Chunk 3127:
cron://show Event?account Email=test@example.com&i Cal UID=51p9lhpkrerfom8cqn9g1btjuu@google.com&start Date=2022-01-05T20:30:00.000Z&end Date2022-01-05T21:00:00.000Z&title=Test&ref=com.example.test

 Does Notion support custom domains?
 Learn how to claim a notion.site domain or connect a custom domain to your Notion Site here →
 Can you link to a specific section of a page?

Chunk 3190:
You can use a table of contents in your public page to create anchor links to its headings.
 If I change my workspace domain name, will my public page URLs still work?
 If you change your workspace domain, any existing links starting with the previous domain will no longer work. You'll need to share the new link. To find the new link, open the published page in Notion and select Share at the top → Publish. Find the URL at the top and select 🔗 next to it to copy it.
 I shared my public page URL but it takes people to a page with a "Continue to external site by following the link below" error message. What did I do wrong?

Chunk 3191:
Make sure you’ve shared the link to the published page, and not the version of the page in your Notion workspace! The link should begin with your Notion workspace domain name. To find it, open the published page in Notion and select Share at the top → Publish. Find the URL at the top and select 🔗 next to it to copy it.
 Can I password protect a page?
 Unfortunately, not at the moment. If the person you want to share a page with has a Notion account, you can share your page privately by selecting Invite a person in the Share menu at the top of a page.

 All workspace members can see and manage their workspace’s Notion Sites by going to Settings & members in their sidebar → Sites.
 From here, workspace members can:
• See domains belonging to the workspace.
• See Notion Sites that they can access through a teamspace, group, parent page, or a direct invitation. This doesn’t include pages that are available to anyone with a link — you must have direct access to the page in Notion.
• Go to the published Site, copy its URL, or open up the publishing settings for it.

 Note: If you’re on a Free plan, you can claim one notion.site domain. If you’re on a paid plan, you can claim up to five.
 To customize and claim a new notion.site domain:
 Go to Settings & members in your sidebar → Sites.
 Next to Domains, select New domain.
 Select Notion domain → Continue.

Chunk 3205:
Once you've set your own workspace domain, it will be displayed at the start of any public page URLs, such as acme.notion.site. The unique acme.notion.site URL is only used for publicly shared pages from within your workspace. Internally, you will still see the URL as notion.so/acme.
 Note:
• Notion reserves the right to reclaim a notion.site domain at any time, at its sole discretion.
• Once you set a custom notion.site domain, you’ll need to continue to actively use your Notion workspace in order to maintain it. If you don’t, you might lose the domain.

Chunk 3206:
• If you switch to a new custom notion.site domain, any existing links starting with the previous domain (previousdomain.notion.site) will no longer work! You'll need to re-share new links containing the new domain.

• When you delete a custom domain, you'll still be able to use it with Notion Sites until the end of your current billing cycle. After that time, you will no longer be charged for that custom domain.

 Note: The following is only available on paid plans.
 Workspace owners on paid plans can connect their existing custom domains with Notion Sites by purchasing the custom domain add-on. Notion doesn’t sell custom domains or replace your current domain provider — the add-on allows you to use Notion Sites with a custom domain you already own.
Custom domain add-on pricing and billing

Chunk 3218:
Once a workspace owner on a paid plan connects a custom domain with Sites, they'll be charged an additional $10 per month. Note that with annual billing, you’ll unlock a discounted rate for the custom domain add-on of an additional $8 per month.
 For each custom domain you want to use with Notion Sites, you’ll have to purchase a separate custom domain add-on. You can do this for up to 25 custom domains.
 Billing for the custom domain add-on must match your billing for Notion — if you pay for Notion annually, you’ll also be billed annually for the custom domain. If you pay for Notion monthly, you’ll also be billed monthly for the custom domain.

Chunk 3219:
If you add a custom domain to your existing paid plan, you’ll pay a prorated amount for the remaining time left on your current billing cycle. On your next billing date, the custom domain add-on charge will be added to your regular billing cadence.
Connect a custom domain
 To connect a custom domain with Notion Sites:
 Go to Settings & members in your sidebar → Sites.
 Next to Domains, select New domain.
 Select Custom domain → Continue. You’ll be prompted to set up a payment method for this add-on if you don’t already have one on file.
 Enter your custom domain → Continue.
 There are a few important rules to follow when adding your domain to ensure a smooth setup:
• You must already have purchased your domain from a DNS provider.

Chunk 3220:
• When entering your domain, you must include a subdomain. This is typically www, but any other subdomain works too (ex.: careers.my-domain.com or portfolio.my-domain.com).
 You must already have purchased your domain from a DNS provider.
 When entering your domain, you must include a subdomain. This is typically www, but any other subdomain works too (ex.: careers.my-domain.com or portfolio.my-domain.com).
 If you want your root domain to point to your Notion Site, we recommend setting up your subdomain to www and setting up a redirect with your DNS provider. Here are some instructions from common providers for how to set this up:

Examples of incorrect DNS configurations

Chunk 3225:
In the setup below, the name of the TXT record is set to notes but should instead be _notion-dcv.notes. The value of the record is set to _notion-dcv.notes but should instead be the unique TXT record code provided in Notion when you’re setting up the custom domain.
 In the setup below, the CNAME host is set to external.notion.site but should instead be set to your desired subdomain, like careers.my-domain.com. The CNAME value is correctly set to external.notion.site.
Setup instructions per DNS provider
 Below are instructions for setting up your CNAME and TXT records with some of the most common DNS providers.
 Note:
• The screenshots used below are just examples. Make sure you use your specific values as you follow the steps!

Chunk 3226:

Duplicate a page
 Let's say you come across a Notion page you love on the web and want to make it your own.
 Log into Notion on your browser.
 Navigate to the public page and click Duplicate in its upper right corner.
 Choose the workspace you'd like to duplicate the page into from the dropdown.
 Your browser will take you to that page, now duplicated into the Private section of your sidebar. It will include all the sub-pages contained in the original page.
 You can edit this page and its sub-pages just like you would any other.
Prevent duplication
 If you have a public page that you don't want duplicated, you can turn that option off.

Chunk 3246:
Go to the page in Notion and click Share.
 Underneath Share to the web, switch off the toggle labeled Allow duplicate as template (it's on by default).

Get started with templates

Build a team notes and docs database

How to create OKRs

 Listening to users is an important part of growing your startup. With Notion, you can create a home for all your user interviews, categorize them, and connect them to your other relevant docs. Plus — you can even make templates to standardize the interview process for anyone on your team.

 Databases are a powerful Notion feature that can unlock your toolmaking potential. Create databases, learn about layout types, and build databases for teams.
Intro to databases

Chunk 3423:
Databases in Notion are collections of pages. Here, we'll introduce you to the general structure of a database, discuss the different menus and options, and deep dive into how to open and edit pages within a database. 🗃
Using database views
 Here, we'll introduce you to the different customization options and layouts that exist once you have a database set up in your workspace.
Timeline view
 Timeline is a type of Notion database that’s way more than a Gantt chart. It gives you complete flexibility to scope projects, adjust their timelines, and customize your workflow.
Table view

Chunk 3424:
Tables are Notion's most traditional database view, but our tables are a lot more powerful than a grid with some rows and columns! Open each row as its own Notion page, or visualize in other database views.
Gallery view
 Galleries are Notion's most visual database view. Use them to showcase beautiful photos for mood boards, team directories, vacation photos and more.
List view
 Lists are Notion's most minimalist database view. All the power of a database, but without the visual clutter. Use them for meeting notes, journal entries, process documentation and more!
Board view

Chunk 3425:
One of Notion's most powerful features, Boards are the best way to manage projects & tasks. Use them to group your databases by select, multiselect, and person properties.
Calendar view
 Calendars are a great way to visualize dates from any database in Notion. Use them for your company's social media planning, or add a calendar view to your product management databases.
Using database templates
 Instead of manually typing out the same structure and content for every new page, you can use database templates to automate your processes and save some time.
Using linked databases

Chunk 3426:
Linked databases let you include synced copies of the same content across different pages. Use them to include a filtered view of team tasks in your meeting notes, or create a dashboard of tasks assigned to you from different databases.
Using advanced database filters
 Managing tasks and projects in Notion just got a big upgrade. With new advanced database filters, you have even more control and customizability over your database views - make them as specific as you want for a more organized and efficient workflow.
Relation and rollup properties
 Notion databases become even more powerful when you link them together. Link to a row from another database with a relation, or show a specific property from a related table with a rollup.

Chunk 3427:
Notion for people ops
 Explain how Notion can keep teams on the same page and be able to set up Notion for large teams using teamspaces.
 Notion for HR & People operations
